when asked about how a certain dish was prepared in comparison to a similar at other thai restaurants , he replied this is not mcdonald 's , every place makes things differently	SERVICE#GENERAL
while it is understandable that every place is indeed different , there was not a need to be uncourteous to customers and downright rude .	SERVICE#GENERAL
the service was poor , restaurant poorly lit , staff not very attentive and i would have rather eaten at a mcdonald 's than this joint .
never again !	RESTAURANT#GENERAL

small , bright , and clean , bz grill stands apart from the usual run of gyro joints , both in astoria and out .

the menu looked great , and the waiter was very nice , but when the food came , it was average .	FOOD#STYLE_OPTIONS	SERVICE#GENERAL	FOOD#QUALITY
nevertheless , i finished my plate , and that 's when i found a maggot in mushroom sauce at the bottom .	FOOD#QUALITY

when the bill came , nothing was comped , so i told the manager very politely that we were willing to pay for the wine , but i did n't think i should have to pay for food with a maggot in it .	SERVICE#GENERAL
yes , i ate the food , but i certainly would not have if i had seen the maggot before eating , and i was at this point fairly sick to my stomach .
the manager finally said he would comp the two glasses of wine ( which cost less than the food ) , and made it seem like a big concession .	SERVICE#GENERAL
we paid and left because we did n't feel like arguing any more .	SERVICE#GENERAL
i have worked in restaurants and cook a lot , and there is no way a maggot should be able to get into well prepared food .	FOOD#QUALITY

fine , i wont hang you for that .

FOOD#QUALITY	FOOD#QUALITY
not one to jump to complaints ( hence my lack of previous online reviewing ) , i called the restaurant to give them a heads up that their kitchen might want to check the cleanliness of their prep stations .
my main concern was the sanity of the food that was being sent out to myself and others , but i would be lying is i said that as someone who has worked in restaurants since the age of fifteen i was expecting at least a minimal effort on the part of the restaurant to amend the situation .

none was made so i hung up .	SERVICE#GENERAL
less than three minutes passed before i found myself doubled over the toilet .	FOOD#QUALITY
my girlfriend , being slightly more aggressive , and having been equally disgusted causing her to throw out the remainder of her barely eaten meal , called back only to be informed that i was probably wrong and that it was most likely an oyster , and that we were also blacklisted from their restaurant .

not only have i worked in restaurants for many years , i am now in culinary school , i am a huge lover of oysters and fish , and my girlfriend is half korean !

easily the worst stir-fried squid i 've ever tasted .	FOOD#QUALITY
the sauce tasted more like chinese fast food than decent korean .	FOOD#QUALITY
the side dishes were passable , and i did get a refill upon request .	FOOD#QUALITY	FOOD#STYLE_OPTIONS
the real problem i had with this place was the complete lack of service .	SERVICE#GENERAL
i mentioned the squid dish was n't very good when the waitress visited .
she just nodded and walked off .	SERVICE#GENERAL
there were no communications issues either , as she spoke perfect english .
as to my comment about the food , no apology or acknowledgment was made .	SERVICE#GENERAL
my wife had barely touched that mess of a dish .	FOOD#QUALITY
we were charged full price .	SERVICE#GENERAL
if you ware looking for korean fusion , i suggest you try some of the places in the east village .
authentic korean food lovers should visit 32nd street , of course .
lives up to the hype	RESTAURANT#GENERAL
we 've lived around the corner from this place for over a year and finally had dinner there .

possibly the most romantic restaurant in the city	AMBIENCE#GENERAL
this is undoubtedly my favorite modern japanese brasserie ( that don’t serve sushi ) , and in my opinion , one of the most romantic restaurants in the city !	RESTAURANT#GENERAL	AMBIENCE#GENERAL
not only is it an adventure getting to this somewhat hidden spot , once you enter the unmarked wooden doors , the zen and intimate décor will make you feel like you’re no longer in the city .	LOCATION#GENERAL	AMBIENCE#GENERAL	AMBIENCE#GENERAL
if you’re planning to come here , make sure that your date is someone whom you really like since you’ll be ushered to private booths where there will be no people or food watching ( choose the ones on the ground level that have glass ceilings so you may see the stars in the sky ! ) .

my party had the bbe $ 29 fixe prix menu , which was such a wonderful deal since it also came with a flight of sake !	FOOD#PRICES	FOOD#STYLE_OPTIONS
i never used to be a fan of sakes but am lately experimenting with it a lot more and am acquiring a better taste of it .
we started off with a delightful sashimi amuse bouche .	FOOD#QUALITY
our first course was tuna sashimi with green yuzu sauce .
i picked the grilled black cod as my entree , which i absolutely devoured while someone commented that the grilled salmon dish was better .	FOOD#QUALITY	FOOD#QUALITY
the entrees were served with miso soup and rice .

for desserts , we tried the frozen black sesame mousse ( interesting but not extraordinary ) and matcha ( powdered green tea ) and blueberry cheesecake , which was phenomenal .	FOOD#QUALITY	FOOD#QUALITY
maybe it was the great company ( i had friends visiting from philly – yes , it was not a date this time ) or the super reasonable price point , but i just can’t say enough good things about this brasserie .	RESTAURANT#GENERAL	RESTAURANT#PRICES

we never ate because by close to 2 in the monring we were not served and were too upset ad tired to start eating .	SERVICE#GENERAL

but for the shabu shabu , you wo n't find much better in ny .	FOOD#QUALITY
in fact there is only one i 've tried that even compares ( shabu tatsu ) and even then i prefer dokebi .
the meat is fresh , the sauces are great , you get kimchi and a salad free with your meal and service is good too .	FOOD#QUALITY	FOOD#QUALITY	SERVICE#GENERAL	FOOD#STYLE_OPTIONS	FOOD#PRICES	FOOD#PRICES

i went here with my boyfriend for our anniversary .
the food was great and tasty , but the sitting space was too small , i do n't like being cramp in a corner .	FOOD#QUALITY	AMBIENCE#GENERAL
over all it was a very nice romantic place .	RESTAURANT#GENERAL	AMBIENCE#GENERAL

the servers at flatbush farm appear to have perfected that ghastly technique of making you feel guilty and ashamed for deigning to attract their attention .	SERVICE#GENERAL
polite acknowledgement is out ;	SERVICE#GENERAL
supercilious scorn is in .	SERVICE#GENERAL
and how many times can you pick up the same perfectly aligned set of napkins , inspect them vapidly and plonk them down in exactly the same place instead of venturing a glance at people who are there to help you make the rent ?	SERVICE#GENERAL
a different server enhanced the fun , dumping our entrees in front of us halfway through our appetizer ( which was delicious ) .	SERVICE#GENERAL	FOOD#QUALITY
overall the food quality was pretty good , though i hear the salmon is much better when it has n't sat cooling in front of the guest .	FOOD#QUALITY	SERVICE#GENERAL
the place has a nice fit-out , some attractive furnishings and , from what i could tell , a reasonable wine list ( i was given the food menu when i asked for the carte des vins )	AMBIENCE#GENERAL	AMBIENCE#GENERAL	DRINKS#STYLE_OPTIONS	SERVICE#GENERAL

how is this palce still open ?	RESTAURANT#GENERAL
i honestly do n't even know where to begin .	RESTAURANT#GENERAL
my boyfriend and i are avid restaurant goers , and we are always on the lookout for new places and our friend had recommended flatbush farms .
we arrived and were seated immediately , which made us both happy .	SERVICE#GENERAL
we ordered our appetizers , i ordered the chicken and my boyfriend the salmon .
everything was going good until we got our meals .	RESTAURANT#GENERAL	FOOD#QUALITY
i took one look at the chicken and i was appalled .	FOOD#STYLE_OPTIONS
it was served with skin , over a bed of extremely undercooked spinach and mashed potatoes .	FOOD#STYLE_OPTIONS	FOOD#QUALITY
my boyfriend asked me if i wanted to switch and eat his salmon instead , while he de-skinned the chicken so that i could enjoy the white meat .
i took one bite from the $ 24 salmon , and i have never , in the 17 years i have been going to restaurants tasted salmon as fishy , as dry , and as bland as the one in flatbush farms .	FOOD#QUALITY	FOOD#PRICES
at this point , the waitress comes over and asks us if everything was okay , i was literally so shocked that i was speechless and did n't say anything , and guess what , the waitress walked away .	SERVICE#GENERAL
so , i switch with my boyfriend again to see if maybe i could stomach the meat and spinach again , but the spinach was so undercooked that i just could not bite through it .	FOOD#QUALITY
i could n't even enjoy the mashed potatoes because it was hidden completely under the chicken and spinach .	FOOD#STYLE_OPTIONS
i 've had better chicken at bbqs ! ! ! !
so i decide to report back to the waitress because it was completely inedible .	FOOD#QUALITY
guess what , i waited for twenty minutes before she came over and when she finally did , she says , `` oh well , i wish you would have said something earlier '' no apology , nothing .	SERVICE#GENERAL
after that she simply took our plates , walked away , came back another twenty minutes later with the bill and the chicken on it ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !	SERVICE#GENERAL
no desert menu , no apology , nothing ! ! ! ! ! !	SERVICE#GENERAL
i was literally going to explode , but instead , my boyfriend took the bill and went to find the manager .
this is where it really really gets bad : the manager said , there is absolutely nothing we can do , it 's a matter of taste that she did n't like it , and i can not comp it .	SERVICE#GENERAL
again , no apology , no is there anything else i can get you , no can i get you a drink to make up for it , nothing ! ! ! !	SERVICE#GENERAL
we refused to pay for it because at this point it had nothing to do with the food anymore .
the level of rudeness was preposterous .	SERVICE#GENERAL
the manager came to the table and said we can do what we want , so we paid for what we did enjoy , the drinks and appetizers , and walked out .	SERVICE#GENERAL	DRINKS#QUALITY	FOOD#QUALITY

casa la femme is to middle eastern dining what chuckie cheeze is to italian .

sometimes you pay a lot and do n't get much in return - it 's manhattan , things are expensive .

we live nearby bfc .
it 's a little out of our price range for dining there except on special occasions , but we 've eaten there 6 times in the last 2 years .	RESTAURANT#PRICES
each time we 've been , the front of house staff ( not the waiters - they 're fantastic - but the people who greet and seat you ) has been so hideous to us that were it not for the exceptional fish dishes i would never return .	SERVICE#GENERAL	SERVICE#GENERAL	FOOD#QUALITY

i was almost amused by the fact that she was turning away customers at 9pm on a friday night because she `` had a bbq to go to '' that night - wtf ? ?	SERVICE#GENERAL
i 'd be horrified if my staff were turning away customers so early and so rudely !	SERVICE#GENERAL
there 's another girl who i ca n't describe , she is about 5'6 '' with brown hair , who eavesdrops on your conversation and chimes in - except she only hears the last part of what you said , so her uninvited opinions are often out of context and nothing to do with what you 're *really* talking about .	SERVICE#GENERAL
i 'm a friendly person , so i would n't mind had she not been so nasty and gotten so personal .	SERVICE#GENERAL
again , i 'd be super upset if that were my employee .	SERVICE#GENERAL
