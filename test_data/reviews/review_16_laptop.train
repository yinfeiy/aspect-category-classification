i would say if you want to buy one of these machines be careful .	LAPTOP#GENERAL

in my house , hp is a nasty word .	COMPANY#GENERAL

a key contributor that led me to mac is the art aspect .	LAPTOP#DESIGN_FEATURES

i am loyal to apple .	COMPANY#GENERAL
the macbooks worth every penny .
they 're easy , fun , powerful and will last a long time .
the great 18 month same as cash financing and advance protection plan which includes accidents like spills . , which apple does n't offer , is why i bought my macbook at best buy .
i am very happy !	LAPTOP#GENERAL
this just keeps having it 's hard drive replaced !	HARD_DISC#QUALITY
acer wo n't replace the laptop .	SUPPORT#QUALITY
the manufacturer 's warranty only covers replacement/repair of parts .	WARRANTY#GENERAL
this thing is a lemon .	LAPTOP#QUALITY
this macbook is an outstanding product with great value .	LAPTOP#GENERAL
its ease of use and the top service from apple- be it their phone assistance or bellying up to the genius bar- can not be beat .	LAPTOP#USABILITY	SUPPORT#QUALITY

i was so excited to receive the toshiba l455 as a gift/bonus for some work i had done for a friend of mine !

my first problem was with the pre-loaded norton firewall/security program .	SOFTWARE#GENERAL

it took toshiba tech support 4 calls and 4 different techs to correct the problem .	SUPPORT#QUALITY
then just the other day , my left `` mouse '' button snapped !	MOUSE#QUALITY
being only 2 months old , i am not a happy camper !	LAPTOP#QUALITY
buyer beware .	LAPTOP#GENERAL
this one , in my opinion , might be a lemon !	LAPTOP#QUALITY
it rarely works and when it does it 's incredibly slow .	LAPTOP#QUALITY	LAPTOP#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE
i have had to take it to the geek squad guys to get it fixed because it has had viruses 3 times and i have not even had it for more then 4 months !	LAPTOP#QUALITY

i 've have n't had any major problems with the laptop except that the plastic piece that covers the usb port wires have all come off .	LAPTOP#GENERAL	PORTS#QUALITY
apparently they are defective since they are not securely attached .	PORTS#QUALITY
i can barely use any usb devices because they will not stay connected properly .	LAPTOP#CONNECTIVITY
i called toshiba and they want me to be without my laptop for about two weeks while they look at the problem .	SUPPORT#QUALITY
i think i might rather suffer for something that is simple to fix in my opinion .	SUPPORT#QUALITY
i bought this laptop was the worst laptop i 've ever bought .	LAPTOP#GENERAL
i spent alot of money on this product and its been a nightmare .	LAPTOP#PRICE	LAPTOP#GENERAL

i sent it to them to fix in perfect condition but for what was wrong with it .
they sent it back with a huge crack in it and it still did n't work .	SUPPORT#QUALITY
and that was the fourth time ive sent it to them to get fixed .	SUPPORT#QUALITY
its been a year and am still waiting to see what there going to do about my laptop .	SUPPORT#QUALITY
so if anyones looking to buy a computer or laptop you should stay far far away from any that have the name toshiba on it ...	COMPANY#GENERAL
i saved for this laptop for 3 months and i can tell you personally it was worth the wait .	LAPTOP#GENERAL
the display on this computer is the best i 've seen in a very long time , the battery life is very long and very convienent .	DISPLAY#GENERAL	BATTERY#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE

okay , let 's just start out by saying i am in no way a computer techy .
i am a wife , mom and a school teacher and a college student .
trying to balance all of my roles leaves very little time for me to do anything , so i want to manage my time i do have to be the most efficient .
i work on a pc at home and have used pc all through college .
i use the computer to basically check emails , surf the web , print coupons and for my college papers .
i was getting extrememly frustrated when i would want to do these simple taks that i would have to wait and wait and wait for things to download or virus that would clog up my pc .
it would take up too much time to do reaearch for my papers and i would be up hours-just because the computer was too slow .

i constantly had to send my laptop in for services every 3 months and it always seems to be the same problem that they said they had already fixed .	LAPTOP#QUALITY	SUPPORT#QUALITY
toshiba customer services will indirectly deal with your problems by constantly tranferring you from one country to another , and i am not kidding you , i called different hours of the day and you 'll get someone else from another country trying to get you to tell them your life story all over again , since they make it sound like they do n't have your history list of your calls right in front of them .	SUPPORT#QUALITY
it 's a long and tirring process that after a while it seems like their game plan was to wear you out so you would want to give up on contacting them .	SUPPORT#QUALITY
and at one point , they blame me for installing a bad memory stick when i upgrade my memory for the first time during my purchase of the laptop ( i bought the memory stick they recomended ) .	SUPPORT#QUALITY
long story short , since i experience so many problems with my laptop every since i bought it from day one , i did n't ask for a new laptop or a refund of what i pay for a crapy laptop , but just an extension of my laptop warranty for another year , they made a big deal of out that and after so many calls and complaints about their products and services , they finally gave in .

i get a ton of compliments on its size , and speaking as someone who regularly commutes on a bus , i can attest to the fact that this is the perfect size computer if you 're restricted to the width of your body for computing room .	LAPTOP#DESIGN_FEATURES	LAPTOP#PORTABILITY
very long-life battery ( up to 10-11 hours depending on how you configure power level settings ) .	BATTERY#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE
i upgraded the memory and replaced the base windows 7 starter to win 7 home , and it runs just fine .	LAPTOP#USABILITY	LAPTOP#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE
i play a lot of casual games online , and the touchpad is very responsive .	MOUSE#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE
the only thing i wish this had was the option to turn off the touchpad with a button like my big 16 '' laptop does .
i would n't play a first-person shooter with this , mind , but if you wanted to run ms office , email , chat , download a video , listen to music from a certain fruit-named music store , and were looking for a highly portable yet powerful netbook to do that all in , i 'd highly recommend checking this out .	LAPTOP#PORTABILITY	LAPTOP#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE	LAPTOP#MISCELLANEOUS
the downside to this netbook is pretty much the same for any netbook : screen size is not something i 'd stare at for the entire 10-11 hours of battery life five days a week .	DISPLAY#DESIGN_FEATURES
additional caveat : the base installation comes with some toshiba-specific software that may or may not be to a user 's liking .	SOFTWARE#DESIGN_FEATURES
i have used both pcs and macs and i have to say that i really really love my mac book pro .
while most people say that pcs hold functionality and value and macs are just pretty to look at , i think there 's something to be said about the simplicity of macs .
everything from the design to the os is simple and to the point .	LAPTOP#DESIGN_FEATURES	OS#USABILITY	LAPTOP#USABILITY

everything i have tried has worked and i never have to carry the wall charger cause the battery is so awesome .	LAPTOP#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE	BATTERY#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE
the only thing that is n't perfect about this netbook is the speakers , they are not loud at all but i expected that .	MULTIMEDIA_DEVICES#QUALITY
i upgraded it 's ram to 2gb , i am very happy with it .	LAPTOP#GENERAL	MEMORY#DESIGN_FEATURES
lots of preloaded software .	LAPTOP#DESIGN_FEATURES
the only problem is that i had to add 1 gb ram , the computer was kinda slow .	MEMORY#DESIGN_FEATURES	LAPTOP#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE

we now own two of these , identical .
as an owner of a toshiba satalite laptop computer things you should know before you buy .
the computer itself is a good product but the repair depot stinks .	LAPTOP#GENERAL	SUPPORT#QUALITY
i have had to send in my laptop three times to get it fixed .	SUPPORT#QUALITY
two of the times was in one month .
i had in the past a dell laptop and they sent me the items it needed or they sent a repair technician to my house to fix it .
toshiba does not send any one out unless you have paid extra to have the on site repair done .	SUPPORT#QUALITY
i would tell the technician i knew exactly what was wrong with it but they did not listen and i had to go through a bunch of junk to get them to tell me i needed to send the computer in .	SUPPORT#QUALITY
this computer that i have has had issues with the keyboard where it lost half the keyboard functions .	KEYBOARD#QUALITY	KEYBOARD#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE
as well as having the plug in the computer come loose .	POWER_SUPPLY#QUALITY
this has happened three times so far .
two times with in one month .
i am not one to throw things like this around but it is a laptop so carrying it around does seem to mean it will be jerked possibly a little , while driving a car and carrying it into where ever you are using it .
so having the ac plug go out on me and get lose or i could actually here it inside my computer on two of the three times is not good .	POWER_SUPPLY#QUALITY
it still seems to be a little lose now but so far seems to be hanging in there .	POWER_SUPPLY#QUALITY
the mac book pro performs flawlessly .	LAPTOP#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE
never had a single problem , and do n't have to worry about viruses .	LAPTOP#GENERAL	LAPTOP#QUALITY
while i mostly use it for email , internet and gaming , i 'm confident all other applications live up to the high standard i 've come to appreciate from mac laptops .	LAPTOP#MISCELLANEOUS
worth the investment and truly a fine piece of equipment .	LAPTOP#GENERAL
right out of the box , this little netbook did everything i asked of it , including streaming the everyday video you 're bound to encounter checking mail and websites ( my biggest complaint previously ) .	LAPTOP#GENERAL	LAPTOP#MISCELLANEOUS
it even has a great webcam , and skype works very well .	LAPTOP#DESIGN_FEATURES	MULTIMEDIA_DEVICES#GENERAL	SOFTWARE#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE
the fact that you can spend over $ 100 on just a webcam underscores the value of this machine .	LAPTOP#GENERAL
the windows 7 starter is , in my opinion , a great way to think about using your netbook : basics , basics , basics .	OS#GENERAL
i wiped nearly everything off of it , installed openoffice and firefox , and i am operating an incredibly efficient and useful machine for a great price .	OS#GENERAL	LAPTOP#PRICE	LAPTOP#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE	LAPTOP#GENERAL
this netbook is a perfect supplementary computer to another laptop or desktop ( my wife and i have another laptop ) , or if you are a user who uses the computer for simple tasks .	LAPTOP#MISCELLANEOUS
i use this for my tutoring business , and since i 'm always bouncing from student to student , it is ideal for portability and battery life ( yes , it gets the 8 hours as advertised ! ) .	LAPTOP#PORTABILITY	BATTERY#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE
finally , i should note that i took the 2gb ram stick from my old eeepc and installed it before i even powered on for the first time .
asus has done an outstanding job of evolving their netbooks , and i would recommend this to anyone who both understands their needs and how netbooks can fit them .	LAPTOP#GENERAL	COMPANY#GENERAL
little short on ram but you get what you pay for .	MEMORY#DESIGN_FEATURES
the hinge design forced you to place various connections all around the computer , left right and front .	LAPTOP#DESIGN_FEATURES	LAPTOP#USABILITY
the headphone and mic jack are in front of touch-pad making the touch-pad hard to use when using headphones/mic , not to mention the laptop was designed for right handed person .	PORTS#DESIGN_FEATURES	MOUSE#USABILITY	LAPTOP#DESIGN_FEATURES	LAPTOP#USABILITY
cords coming out the right for power plus cords coming out front for headphones/mic plus network connection on left make for a very messy setup with cords going every direction .	LAPTOP#DESIGN_FEATURES	LAPTOP#USABILITY
i love windows 7 but i ca n't give toshiba any credit for that , unless y'all get serious about ergonomics and making required connections less obtrusive i will be looking to different manufacturer next time .	OS#GENERAL	LAPTOP#USABILITY	LAPTOP#DESIGN_FEATURES	COMPANY#GENERAL
i was happy with my purchase of a toshiba satellite l305d-s5934 laptop until it came time to have it repaired under the toshiba warranty .	LAPTOP#GENERAL	SUPPORT#QUALITY
the computer was shipped to their repair depot on june 24 and returned on july 2 seems like a short turn around time except the computer was not repaired when it was returned .	SHIPPING#QUALITY	SUPPORT#QUALITY
i called their repair depot as was told they would send me a new box to return the computer to the repair depot .
they were totally unconcerned that the computer was not correctly repaired in the first place .	SUPPORT#QUALITY
the computer is currently in west verginia doe to the method of shipping choosen by toshiba .	SHIPPING#QUALITY
the computer could have been shipped by priority mail through the usps for the same cost and arrived by noon on tue .	SHIPPING#QUALITY
instead it is sitting in west verginia waiting for ups to take two days to send me a box and two days for them to ship the computer some 691 miles by air ? to louisville ky .	SHIPPING#QUALITY
by air sounds more like by truck to me .
and toshiba is totally unconcerned .	SUPPORT#QUALITY
the reaction of toshiba is there is nothing you can do about it so just sit back and except the fact that you are powerless and it is mind over matter .	SUPPORT#QUALITY
we do n't mind and you do n't matter .	SUPPORT#QUALITY
i would not recommend the purchase of this modle of toshiba computer or any toshiba product for that matter .	LAPTOP#GENERAL	COMPANY#GENERAL

i 've had this laptop for about a month now .
it has served my needs quite nicely for the most part .	LAPTOP#GENERAL
the 2 gb of ram is plenty , able to run windows 7 and at least 2 or 3 other programs with next to no slowdown .	MEMORY#DESIGN_FEATURES	LAPTOP#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE
the ati graphics card is a huge plus , definitely a good value if you need to be able to run some slightly older games that a intel built-in card would have trouble with , such as half-life 2 or even world of warcraft .
my one complaint with this laptop is that i 've noticed an electronic fuzz sound coming out of the headphone jack when headphones are plugged in .	PORTS#QUALITY
this is likely due to poor grounding and isolation between the components , and i 'm hoping that it can be fixed with a ground loop isolator , but i still expected better product quality for this price range .	HARDWARE#QUALITY	LAPTOP#PRICE
other than that , i would recommend this to someone in need of a cheap laptop with semi-decent gaming capabilities .	LAPTOP#PRICE	LAPTOP#MISCELLANEOUS
let me start with the good : so awesome .	LAPTOP#GENERAL

this is my second macbook .
the first one i had was a 2006 model , not the pro .
i fell in love with it .
this one has had the same effect .	LAPTOP#GENERAL
i had upgraded my old macbook to lion , so i kind of knew what i was getting , but had n't been able to enjoy some of the awesome new multi-touch features .
the improvements to the os have been relatively gradual , but substantive .	OS#GENERAL
the feel of this machine compared to the old macbook is far superior .
the unibody construction is solid , sleek and beautiful .	LAPTOP#DESIGN_FEATURES	LAPTOP#QUALITY
it is everything i 'd hoped it would be from a look and feel standpoint , but somehow a bit more sturdy .	LAPTOP#DESIGN_FEATURES	LAPTOP#QUALITY
for the not so good , i got the stock screen - which is very glossy .	DISPLAY#QUALITY
it 's still beautiful and has better color reproduction than i could ever expect from a notebook .	DISPLAY#DESIGN_FEATURES	DISPLAY#QUALITY
the reflectiveness of the display is only a minor inconvenience if you work in a controlled-lighting environment like me ( i prefer it dark ) or if you can crank up the brightness .	DISPLAY#QUALITY	DISPLAY#USABILITY
my real problem with it ?
the statement of 7 hour battery life is not just mere exaggeration -- it 's a lie .	BATTERY#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE
i challenge anyone to show proof that through anywhere near normal use can get more than 2.5 hrs out of it .	BATTERY#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE
the first full charge of this battery got me only about 2 full hours .	BATTERY#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE
enabling the battery timer is useless .	BATTERY#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE
the `` time remaining '' goes from 4 hours plus to less than 2 hours over the span of about 10 minutes .	BATTERY#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE
it 's a joke .
it 's so bad that i 'm thinking i only got half a battery or something .	BATTERY#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE
i know what 7 hrs of battery looks like .	BATTERY#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE
this ai n't it .
my only other complaint is that it gets really hot . : - )	LAPTOP#QUALITY
if you buy this - do n't go into it expecting 7 hrs of battery life , and you 'll be perfectly satisfied .	BATTERY#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE	LAPTOP#GENERAL

the only thing i did n't learn in my research was the software i would need like privacy protection and warranty protection , in case it gets broken , or crashes etc .
i do n't have that additional money right now , and therefore would n't have purchased it at this time .
those things are very important - vital even !

the notebook is lacking a hdmi port and a s-video port that would enable one to hook it to a tv .	LAPTOP#DESIGN_FEATURES	LAPTOP#CONNECTIVITY

before we got this laptop , had a compaq pasaro for 5 years with no problems .
after the bad experience with this computer went back to compaq .
i hate it .	LAPTOP#GENERAL
i have had the luxury ( sarcasm ) of owning 2 of these laptops .	LAPTOP#GENERAL
the first fell apart right after the 1-year-warranty .	LAPTOP#QUALITY
during that time , i had to send it back 3 times .	LAPTOP#QUALITY

i wanted to purchase the extended warranty and they refused , because they knew it was trouble .	SUPPORT#QUALITY	LAPTOP#GENERAL
i had something else go wrong and they said it had to be in good working order to be able to buy the warranty .	SUPPORT#QUALITY
i took it to friend who temporarily fixed it and i finally paid about 1500 for the extended warranty .	WARRANTY#PRICE
i sent it back and they lost it .	SUPPORT#QUALITY
i waited and waited and no laptop .	SUPPORT#QUALITY
finally after months of research the discovered that they mailed it to a walmart and there probably would be no way to find the box .	SUPPORT#QUALITY
i waited another month for approval and for them to `` build '' me a new laptop .	SUPPORT#QUALITY
i was psyched .
i thought all my problems would finally be solved being that my old computer would n't go onto our wireless network and i would n't have the same problems because it was updated .
here we are another year later and the computer is doing the same thing .	SUPPORT#QUALITY
hp did n't fix it .	SUPPORT#QUALITY

they had me send in the machine last april returned it to me in may with no documentation on what was done it anything .	SUPPORT#QUALITY
now the machine wo n't connect and toshiba says that they did replace the connection card in may but they only warranty the repair for 30 days and now i 'm out of warranty even though this has been a constant 5 month occurance since i bought the netbook .	LAPTOP#CONNECTIVITY	SUPPORT#QUALITY
so buyer beware when buying toshiba	COMPANY#GENERAL
i bought this laptop the moment unibody product came to the market .
i also bought one for my wife , and 3 for my office .
they are wonderful , but very dangerous when it comes to emitting heat .	LAPTOP#GENERAL	LAPTOP#QUALITY
i burned my leg , after lifting it from my desk , and for less than 5 second putting it on my lap to clean my coffee table , so i can place it there .	LAPTOP#QUALITY
i had to call apple 19 times ( each time 40 to 75 minutes on the phone ) , and take it to their store for evaluations , and diagnostics , 5 times .	SUPPORT#QUALITY
this is what they told me : it heats up , and that is the reason we no longer call them laptops , and simply categorize them as portables .
you might think , i am new in this game , but i am a gadget lover , and have had more than 2 dozens laptops in the past 15 years , and none gets this hot , that fast .
i also experience the same with my macbook air .
so you might ask , what did apple do for me ?
for my burn thigh which has put a permanent mark on my skin ( it happened 7 months ago ) they offered me an itouch 8gig ( you know it is a bit insulating when a company this rich , offer a loyal customer like me , a bottom of their product line as a gift for events like this ) .	COMPANY#GENERAL
steve jobs , probably needs help and donations , and can not afford a reasonable offers for people that truly are trying to support his baby .	COMPANY#GENERAL
the lesson learned here is : it does not pay to by this loyal to any brand , since all of them are there to simply to make as much money as possible , as fast as they can , and in this day and age , the customer no longer is right all the times .	COMPANY#GENERAL
sad very sad .
i had meant to purchase the nb205 and bought this one by accident ( long story ) .
i am not going to sit here and complain about it not having a cd drive and what not because it is a netbook , it is made to be compact and if you want all the other stuff get a laptop .	LAPTOP#DESIGN_FEATURES
anyways i bought this two months ago and when i first brought it home it kept giving me a message about a vibration in the hard drive and it is putting it temporaly in save zone .	HARD_DISC#QUALITY
so i called customer support ( which is good too ) and they went through it and it is just a safety feature and it does not affect performance at all , i just chose to hide the message .	SUPPORT#QUALITY
i have had the netbook for 2 months and i love it , i read some reviews that say netbooks are slow but it does not seem any slower than the other computers i use .
also the speakers are not very loud , but it is a netbook .	MULTIMEDIA_DEVICES#QUALITY
would highly recommend this netbook though .	LAPTOP#GENERAL
i paid for extra memory and the 17-inch screen , as well as the top of the line dvd and cd burners .
i custom ordered the machine from hp and could not understand the techie due to his accent .	SUPPORT#QUALITY
finally was able to reach a young lady in california and ordered the machine and was subsequently given a delivery date .
the leather carrying case , keyboard and mouse arrived in two days from memphis warehouse .
the computer was two weeks late in delivery because hp forgot to complete the required import paperwork .	SHIPPING#QUALITY
my laptop cost approximately $ 2,300 and died after only 2-years , 10-months and 18-days of use .	LAPTOP#QUALITY	LAPTOP#PRICE
although my model was listed as recalled , hp denied my claim .	SUPPORT#QUALITY
accordingly , i have decided to never purchase another hp product ( my five year old compaq ) lasted 5-years before the hard drive crashed .
i visited the apple store and was impressed with the 17-inch macbook pro .
the quality , engineering design and warranty are superior -- covers damage from dropping the laptop .
if the number of patrons in the apple store are any indication , hp and other pc manufacturers need to take note .
this laptop leaves alot to be desired , i have had it only 5 months and have had to send it away to be repaired twice ...	LAPTOP#GENERAL	LAPTOP#QUALITY
i bought it from hsn because it was `` bundled '' with extra software , but as it turns out , that software just crashes it more often ... ..	SOFTWARE#GENERAL	LAPTOP#DESIGN_FEATURES	LAPTOP#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE

i know that everyone thinks macs are overpriced and overrated , but once you get past the initial expense you 'll find that they 're worth every penny ( besides , there 's always the financing plan that best buy offers ) .
the 13 '' macbook pro is portable , durable , and very capable .	LAPTOP#QUALITY	LAPTOP#PORTABILITY	LAPTOP#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE
it has a 10 hour battery life when you 're doing web browsing and word editing , making it perfect for the classroom or office , and in terms of gaming and movie playing it 'll have a battery life of just over 5 hours .	BATTERY#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE	LAPTOP#MISCELLANEOUS
it 's also very energy efficient , running on a quarter of the power it takes to run a 60 watt lightbulb .	LAPTOP#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE
it 's graphics are n't bad at all , for the lower end of the macbook pro spectrum , easily capable of running starcraft ii and other games with comparable graphics .	GRAPHICS#GENERAL	LAPTOP#MISCELLANEOUS
it 's also very capable of doing moderate video editing ( although you may need the performance boost of the larger macbook pros for heavy duty mobile video editing ) .
the operating system and user interface is very intuitive , and the large multi-touch track pad is amazing .	OS#USABILITY	MOUSE#DESIGN_FEATURES
typically , when i purchase a new laptop i always end up using an external mouse for convenience .
however , the multi-touch gestures and large tracking area make having an external mouse unnecessary ( unless you 're gaming ) .	MOUSE#DESIGN_FEATURES	MOUSE#USABILITY
still , this laptop is perfect for all day use at school and work .	LAPTOP#MISCELLANEOUS
they also have a longer service life than other computers ( i have several friends who still use the older apple powerbooks ) .	LAPTOP#QUALITY
me and my boyfriend bought the gateway nv78 in nov of 09 .
bought with a credit card .
probbly the worst decision we ever made !	LAPTOP#GENERAL
it has bein into the shop to get a new hardrive 2 times and to fix the touch control buttons on the keyboard !	KEYBOARD#QUALITY	HARD_DISC#QUALITY
the place we bought it from said that after they send it out to gateway 4 times they would give us a new one .
the last time we took it to get fixed the guy said that most likely it is a reppative problem and will keep happeneing so hopefully we can get a new one very soon !
pretty much everything else about the computer is good it just stops working out of no were .	LAPTOP#GENERAL	LAPTOP#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE
i love the size of the computer since i play games on it .	LAPTOP#DESIGN_FEATURES
i also love having the extra calculator number set up on the keyboard which most laptops do not have .	KEYBOARD#DESIGN_FEATURES
also the keyboard does not liht up so unless your sitting in a room with some light you cant see anything and thats bad for me because my boyfriend tends to watch tv in the dark at night which leaves me with no way of seeing the keyboard .	KEYBOARD#DESIGN_FEATURES	KEYBOARD#USABILITY
so i would not reccomend anyone buying this computer	LAPTOP#GENERAL
first , it does not have a push button to open the lid .	LAPTOP#DESIGN_FEATURES
it is held in place magnetically .	LAPTOP#DESIGN_FEATURES
there is a little indent to help open it - but good luck with that .	LAPTOP#DESIGN_FEATURES	LAPTOP#USABILITY
once open , the leading edge is razor sharp .	LAPTOP#DESIGN_FEATURES
this is the complete opposite to an ergonomic design .	LAPTOP#DESIGN_FEATURES	LAPTOP#USABILITY
using this machine is like a mild form of torture .	LAPTOP#USABILITY
in the shop , these macbooks are encased in a soft rubber enclosure - so you will never know about the razor edge until you buy it , get it home , break the seal and use it ( very clever con ) .
the much lauded combined touch pad and clicker is a nightmare .	MOUSE#DESIGN_FEATURES
i lost two items i was working on until i figured out what was happening .	MOUSE#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE	MOUSE#USABILITY
also , the space bar makes a noisy click every time you use it .	KEYBOARD#QUALITY
i hate to say this , but if i could take this back to the shop and get my money back , then i would .	LAPTOP#GENERAL
it is absolutely horrible to use , despite all its so called advanced features .	LAPTOP#USABILITY	LAPTOP#DESIGN_FEATURES
i regret buying it before understanding how awful it is to use .	LAPTOP#GENERAL	LAPTOP#USABILITY
buy this if you like being tortured , teased , frustrated and wasting twice as much time as you spent using your old mac .
it 's a bummer and one out of five is being kind .	LAPTOP#GENERAL
my mac has gone from being a trusted friend to an adversary .	LAPTOP#GENERAL
i 'm going to try and keep my old g4 on the road for as long as possible .
in due course , i 'll remove the hard disc from this new macbook pro and dump it where it belongs - in the trash .	LAPTOP#GENERAL
this is the first time that i tried and owning a netbook although i have used 3 different laptops in the past 10 years , i find not much difference except of course for the screen size .
but the screen size is not that bad for email and web browsing .	DISPLAY#DESIGN_FEATURES
i like this machine because its very lightweight ...	LAPTOP#DESIGN_FEATURES
very convenient when you travel and the battery life is excellent ...	BATTERY#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE	LAPTOP#PORTABILITY
10 hours of battery life is really something else ... .	BATTERY#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE
i highly recommend that you buy this product .	LAPTOP#GENERAL
i 've owned every `` pro '' model apple laptop for the last 8 years , this is by far the worst one i 've ever had .

the only drawback for me is how dirty the screen gets , and rather quickly too .	DISPLAY#QUALITY

dell is a decently made pc .	LAPTOP#GENERAL
although its windows vista compared to windows xp sucks .
the graphics are awful and the wireless switch it at the top rather than the side which i am used to it being on the side .	GRAPHICS#GENERAL	LAPTOP#DESIGN_FEATURES	LAPTOP#USABILITY
with the switch being at the top you need to memorize the key combination rather than just flicking a switch .	LAPTOP#DESIGN_FEATURES	LAPTOP#USABILITY

i just ca n't fathom that the celebrated dell would last a week in environment of free competition with normal products - it only survives b/c its substandard laptops are forced onto captive students and employees through question-raising programs .
mine came at $ 1,700 w/o a dvd burner ( ! ) .	LAPTOP#DESIGN_FEATURES	LAPTOP#PRICE
enough said .
the screen is framed by half- to a full-inch margin that is obviously unnecessary , reduces the screen size and increases the bulk .	DISPLAY#DESIGN_FEATURES

it is easy to operate and i have already ordered more software and gadgets for my new rolls royce of laptops .	LAPTOP#USABILITY	LAPTOP#GENERAL
before i bought my new i5 , i did my research for about 2 weeks and determined to move for hp to apple for reliability , dependable , and long lasting operations .

in short i would never buy a compaq again .	COMPANY#GENERAL
my last computer , a toshiba , cost only $ 400 , and worked like a charm for many years .
i bought this laptop on saturday and am completely in love with it !	LAPTOP#GENERAL
it was super easy to set up and is really easy to get used to .	LAPTOP#USABILITY
the online tutorial videos make it super easy to learn if you have always used a pc .	LAPTOP#USABILITY
i now travel with this laptop and my work pc .
i love the mac so much better than my work pc !
i will never go back to windows !
never any doubt i would get a macbook , just was n't sure which one .
after talking it over with the very knowledgeable sales associate , i chose the macbook pro over the white macbook .
the performance is awesome .	LAPTOP#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE
i will never complain about the price since i believe you get what you pay for and my macbook pro was worth every dollar .	LAPTOP#GENERAL	LAPTOP#PRICE

the problem i had with this unit was unresolvable .	LAPTOP#GENERAL
it had a cooling system malfunction after 10 minutes of general use , and would not move past this error .	FANS_COOLING#QUALITY	FANS_COOLING#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE
i realize that not every unit has this issue , but the ones that do can not be repaired .
i acually believe the issue is with the nvidia grafics card , but still requires a return .	GRAPHICS#GENERAL	LAPTOP#GENERAL
instead of taking another chance on toshiba , i went with an asus g73jh-x3 .
they offer the best warranty in the business , and do n't 3rd party it out like toshiba .
for the same price , you get a lot more in the asus ... .1920x1080 res./ awesome cooling system/ much better grafics card ( ati 5870 ) / 8gb ram/ led backlit screen ...
sorry toshiba , but 1st impressions do count for something .	COMPANY#GENERAL
i got the black macbook two years ago and have never regretted it .	LAPTOP#GENERAL
it was a hard decision for me since the macbook pro looked so appealing .
but to be honest , i do n't use my computer for anything like graphics editing and complex data analysis and gaming .
so this was great for me .	LAPTOP#GENERAL
it has just enough ram to run smoothly and enough memory to satisfy my needs .	LAPTOP#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE	MEMORY#DESIGN_FEATURES
plus it is small and reasonably light so i can take it with me to and from work .	LAPTOP#DESIGN_FEATURES	LAPTOP#PORTABILITY
i also travel with it and it never gives me any problems .	LAPTOP#PORTABILITY	LAPTOP#GENERAL
it was also cheaper than the pro which made it even more appealing to me .
sadly apple has discontinued this macbook , i think it was never super popular since it fell somewhere in between the cheapest white model and the smaller pros .
but i am glad to have gotten mine right before they stopped making it .	LAPTOP#GENERAL
i look forward to years of use , it has held up well over the years and it fits my needs very well .	LAPTOP#QUALITY	LAPTOP#GENERAL
i bought this laptop about a month ago to replace my compaq laptop .
i paid about the same for my toshiba as i did for the compaq a few years back .
the difference is the toshiba had a lot more memory and hard drive space .	MEMORY#DESIGN_FEATURES	HARD_DISC#DESIGN_FEATURES
it 's super fast and a great value for the price !	LAPTOP#GENERAL	LAPTOP#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE	LAPTOP#PRICE
i would definitely recommend checking out this laptop if you are in the market for one .	LAPTOP#GENERAL
no complaints with their desktop , and maybe because it just sits on your desktop , and you do n't carry it around , which could jar the hard drive , or the motherboard .
bought this gateway m-50 or 150 early 2007 .
a month later , we reinstall the os ( vista ) .	OS#QUALITY
a coupla months later , they change my hard drive .	HARD_DISC#QUALITY
a month or so ago , the freaking motherboard just died .	MOTHERBOARD#QUALITY

and i 'm still paying the bloody financing , for a product which did n't last me at least three years !	LAPTOP#QUALITY
i initially purchased my macbook pro 13 '' in april , and i loved it .	LAPTOP#GENERAL
i had never owned a mac before ;
i had always used pcs and been constantly frustrated by the crashing and the poorly designed operating systems that were never very intuitive .
i was so happy with my new mac .	LAPTOP#GENERAL
for 2 months .
then the hard drive failed ;	HARD_DISC#QUALITY
my information was all lost ( my fault , i know , but i never thought i would need to back up my information on a brand new mac , the paragon of all computers !	LAPTOP#MISCELLANEOUS
so , after apple replaced the hard drive i enjoyed another 4 months of my new computer , until it froze this morning -- completely .	LAPTOP#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE
i ca n't even turn it off .	LAPTOP#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE
it 's catatonic .	LAPTOP#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE
even if apple replaces whatever needs replacing i wonder if , since i seem to be doubling the amount of time i get out of it each time it 's `` like new , '' i might have 8 months next time .	LAPTOP#QUALITY
oh , boy !
i would rate this computer at 5 stars , but considering it has a short life span i can only give it 1 and implore anyone looking at laptops to stay away from this machine .	LAPTOP#QUALITY	LAPTOP#GENERAL

at least those computers did n't just die on me like this one .

very disappointing :	LAPTOP#GENERAL
i was not aware that this product can not display websites that contain flash .	LAPTOP#USABILITY
about 1/2 of the sites i need to visit because of my work contain some type of flash .
web access through the 3g network is so slow , it 's very frustrating and very disappointing .	LAPTOP#CONNECTIVITY
one of the primary reasons why i purchased an ipad was to store photographs so that i could show to my customers .
after purchasing this thing , i find out that i need a special interface device to connect my camera , and that it can not be purchased at the store - only on line .	LAPTOP#CONNECTIVITY
i go to purchase it on line , and i find out that the device will not be available until almost two months later !
i now realize that my $ 900 would have been better spent on a windows laptop .
hp pavilion dv9000 notebook pc when i first got this computer , it really rocked .	LAPTOP#GENERAL

games being the main issue .	SOFTWARE#USABILITY
it drives me crazy when i want to download a game or something of that nature and i ca n't play it because its not compatable with the software .	SOFTWARE#USABILITY

other than that i do n't have one complaint in the world !	LAPTOP#GENERAL

it seems that this computer might be a lemon .	LAPTOP#QUALITY
i purchased it through amazon .
i have had one complaint into the supplier but got little support .
i am taking the computer to apple to see what they think .
i purchased my macbook pro retina from my school since i had a student discount , but i would gladly purchase it from amazon for full price again if i had too .	LAPTOP#GENERAL
the retina is great , its amazingly fast when it boots up because of the ssd storage and the clarity of the screen is amazing as well .	LAPTOP#GENERAL	LAPTOP#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE	HARD_DISC#DESIGN_FEATURES	DISPLAY#QUALITY

disclaimer : i 'm a mac user .
i wanted to love this laptop , which i bought as a transitional laptop to use between jobs , before my new university gave me one .

would be a very nice laptop if the mousepad worked properly .	LAPTOP#GENERAL	MOUSE#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE
it was not responsive at all to touch .	MOUSE#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE
very frustrating .
and while tapping the mousepad to try to get it to work , your palm would inevitably touch the side which would pull up the side windows and block your ability to find the mouse .	MOUSE#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE	MOUSE#USABILITY
if they can fix this , i think it would be a very nice , cost-effective laptop .	LAPTOP#GENERAL	LAPTOP#PRICE

it does make a little noise but that 's alright as it 's not too much .	LAPTOP#QUALITY

but the touchpad is soooooooooo big that whenever i am typing , my palm touches some part of it and then the cursor goes somewhere else and it 's really annoying .	MOUSE#DESIGN_FEATURES	MOUSE#USABILITY
i prefer typing without having to see the keyboard but due the large touchpad , i always have to type cautiously as my hand might take me somewhere else .	MOUSE#DESIGN_FEATURES	MOUSE#USABILITY

i will never buy another lenovo anything !	LAPTOP#GENERAL	COMPANY#GENERAL
unless you plan on using a mouse with this laptop , do n't buy this .	MOUSE#GENERAL
the touchpad has n't worked correctly since delivery though in the beginning , i thought perhaps it was just a bit of a quirk since most touchpads i 've worked with have some inherent oddities .	MOUSE#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE	MOUSE#QUALITY
this one however , is now very loose and i have to either tap hard or repeatedly push to click in order for it to work , then suddenly , i can barely touch it at all and it clicks on its own .	MOUSE#QUALITY	MOUSE#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE	MOUSE#USABILITY
today , it has n't worked at all more than it has .	MOUSE#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE

the worst computer i have ever laid my eyes upon .	LAPTOP#GENERAL
firstly , it has no leds to let you know what is going on , no cap lock , no hard drive indicator , nothing .	LAPTOP#DESIGN_FEATURES
ok , one light to let you know if the damn thing is on .	LAPTOP#DESIGN_FEATURES
the biggie though is the fact that it disconnects from the internet whenever if feels like it , even when the strength bar is filled .	LAPTOP#CONNECTIVITY
also , when you try to download a large file , like a video , it will start out normally , downloading at around 600kb/sec and over the course of a couple of minutes will slow waaaaaay down to around 20kb/sec , making a download of a couple minutes into several hours making it worthless .

get a probook instead .
too often i would find it not being able to stay connected to the internet .	LAPTOP#CONNECTIVITY

i am really not happy with this computer ...	LAPTOP#GENERAL

i do n't like windows 8 but that is no fault of the computer but the keyboard is so hard to get the keys to work and the space bar .	OS#GENERAL	KEYBOARD#USABILITY	KEYBOARD#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE
would not buy it again .	LAPTOP#GENERAL
meh ... but cheap .	LAPTOP#GENERAL	LAPTOP#PRICE
i bought this so that i could sit on the couch and surf internet with a larger screen than ipad was offering .
the reviews at the time in late july 2014 were mostly positive and it was the best selling laptop with almost 4 star review ...
the first thing i can say for positive is that the laptop is very light- makes it really portable..this with a relatively clear screen is a bonus .	LAPTOP#DESIGN_FEATURES	LAPTOP#PORTABILITY	DISPLAY#QUALITY
now the graphics are not hd ... and the reason that it is light is that it is really basic ( medium low grade ) plastic .	GRAPHICS#QUALITY	LAPTOP#QUALITY
so if you do n't have kids , or not in high school or do n't accidently sit on it , it should be fine .	LAPTOP#QUALITY
now the speed is disappointing .	LAPTOP#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE
start up is fine maybe 20 secs at most , but then to get pages to load on internet is molasses at times .	LAPTOP#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE
even for a 4gb ram it barely chugs with 3 tabs open .	LAPTOP#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE	MEMORY#DESIGN_FEATURES
i tried all the window updates ( this worked for a couple of hp laptops i7in that i bought later at bb ) to see if it could remove the drag , it did not .
really at this point i am trying to confirm if the ram can be upgraded to see if i can do that to help .
couple that with lack of inbuilt bluetooth , dvd drive you are looking at a close tie ( or even a loss ) compared with the other laptops on sale in mid to late august 2014 .
the hp laptops 17in ( with i3 core and amd ) i mentioned before from the other big electronic bb store smoked this one even before i updated windows and upped the ram .
but alas they were gifts ... and what is a gift if not given ?
all in all i wish i had waited a bit .	LAPTOP#GENERAL
but then again hindsight is 20/20 .
bought a usb dvd rw drive but have not used it yet .
this laptop is amazing !	LAPTOP#GENERAL
