not one to jump to complaints ( hence my lack of previous online reviewing ) , i called the restaurant to give them a heads up that their kitchen might want to check the cleanliness of their prep stations .
my main concern was the sanity of the food that was being sent out to myself and others , but i would be lying is i said that as someone who has worked in restaurants since the age of fifteen i was expecting at least a minimal effort on the part of the restaurant to amend the situation .

the food we ordered was excellent , although i would n't say the margaritas were anything to write home about .	FOOD#QUALITY|food	DRINKS#QUALITY|margaritas
our waitress was n't mean , but not especially warm or attentive either .	SERVICE#GENERAL|waitress
i must say i am surprised by the bad reviews of the restaurant earlier in the year , though .	RESTAURANT#GENERAL|restaurant
maybe it has improved since then ?
regardless , we 'll be back and ca n't wait to visit in the summer to take advantage of the patio .	AMBIENCE#GENERAL|patio	RESTAURANT#GENERAL|null

the servers at flatbush farm appear to have perfected that ghastly technique of making you feel guilty and ashamed for deigning to attract their attention .	SERVICE#GENERAL|servers
polite acknowledgement is out ;	SERVICE#GENERAL|null
supercilious scorn is in .	SERVICE#GENERAL|null
and how many times can you pick up the same perfectly aligned set of napkins , inspect them vapidly and plonk them down in exactly the same place instead of venturing a glance at people who are there to help you make the rent ?	SERVICE#GENERAL|null
a different server enhanced the fun , dumping our entrees in front of us halfway through our appetizer ( which was delicious ) .	SERVICE#GENERAL|server	FOOD#QUALITY|appetizer
overall the food quality was pretty good , though i hear the salmon is much better when it has n't sat cooling in front of the guest .	FOOD#QUALITY|food	SERVICE#GENERAL|null
the place has a nice fit-out , some attractive furnishings and , from what i could tell , a reasonable wine list ( i was given the food menu when i asked for the carte des vins )	AMBIENCE#GENERAL|fit-out	AMBIENCE#GENERAL|furnishings	DRINKS#STYLE_OPTIONS|wine list	SERVICE#GENERAL|null
at $ 120 for two people , however , this in no way represents value , unless you 're looking to pay by the hour for passive-aggressive torture .	RESTAURANT#PRICES|null	RESTAURANT#GENERAL|null	SERVICE#GENERAL|null

how is this palce still open ?	RESTAURANT#GENERAL|palce
i honestly do n't even know where to begin .	RESTAURANT#GENERAL|null
my boyfriend and i are avid restaurant goers , and we are always on the lookout for new places and our friend had recommended flatbush farms .
we arrived and were seated immediately , which made us both happy .	SERVICE#GENERAL|null
we ordered our appetizers , i ordered the chicken and my boyfriend the salmon .
everything was going good until we got our meals .	RESTAURANT#GENERAL|null	FOOD#QUALITY|meals
i took one look at the chicken and i was appalled .	FOOD#STYLE_OPTIONS|chicken
it was served with skin , over a bed of extremely undercooked spinach and mashed potatoes .	FOOD#STYLE_OPTIONS|null	FOOD#QUALITY|spinach
my boyfriend asked me if i wanted to switch and eat his salmon instead , while he de-skinned the chicken so that i could enjoy the white meat .
i took one bite from the $ 24 salmon , and i have never , in the 17 years i have been going to restaurants tasted salmon as fishy , as dry , and as bland as the one in flatbush farms .	FOOD#QUALITY|salmon	FOOD#PRICES|salmon
at this point , the waitress comes over and asks us if everything was okay , i was literally so shocked that i was speechless and did n't say anything , and guess what , the waitress walked away .	SERVICE#GENERAL|waitress
so , i switch with my boyfriend again to see if maybe i could stomach the meat and spinach again , but the spinach was so undercooked that i just could not bite through it .	FOOD#QUALITY|spinach
i could n't even enjoy the mashed potatoes because it was hidden completely under the chicken and spinach .	FOOD#STYLE_OPTIONS|null
i 've had better chicken at bbqs ! ! ! !
so i decide to report back to the waitress because it was completely inedible .	FOOD#QUALITY|null
guess what , i waited for twenty minutes before she came over and when she finally did , she says , `` oh well , i wish you would have said something earlier '' no apology , nothing .	SERVICE#GENERAL|null
after that she simply took our plates , walked away , came back another twenty minutes later with the bill and the chicken on it ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !	SERVICE#GENERAL|null
no desert menu , no apology , nothing ! ! ! ! ! !	SERVICE#GENERAL|null
i was literally going to explode , but instead , my boyfriend took the bill and went to find the manager .
this is where it really really gets bad : the manager said , there is absolutely nothing we can do , it 's a matter of taste that she did n't like it , and i can not comp it .	SERVICE#GENERAL|manager
again , no apology , no is there anything else i can get you , no can i get you a drink to make up for it , nothing ! ! ! !	SERVICE#GENERAL|null
we refused to pay for it because at this point it had nothing to do with the food anymore .
the level of rudeness was preposterous .	SERVICE#GENERAL|null
the manager came to the table and said we can do what we want , so we paid for what we did enjoy , the drinks and appetizers , and walked out .	SERVICE#GENERAL|manager	DRINKS#QUALITY|drinks	FOOD#QUALITY|appetizers

casa la femme is to middle eastern dining what chuckie cheeze is to italian .
the reason there are 4 different results on citysearch for the same place is because they keep trying to start a new thread so they can stock it with positive reviews .	RESTAURANT#MISCELLANEOUS|null

i live in the west village and i 've been to a lot of restaurants .
sometimes you pay a lot and do n't get much in return - it 's manhattan , things are expensive .
however , most of them are at least prompt and pleasant .
this place ... god where do i begin .	RESTAURANT#GENERAL|place
it is quite a spectacular scene i 'll give them that .	AMBIENCE#GENERAL|scene

fabulous food - if the front of house staff do n't put you off –	FOOD#QUALITY|food	SERVICE#GENERAL|front of house staff
we live nearby bfc .
it 's a little out of our price range for dining there except on special occasions , but we 've eaten there 6 times in the last 2 years .	RESTAURANT#PRICES|null
each time we 've been , the front of house staff ( not the waiters - they 're fantastic - but the people who greet and seat you ) has been so hideous to us that were it not for the exceptional fish dishes i would never return .	SERVICE#GENERAL|waiters	SERVICE#GENERAL|front of house staff	FOOD#QUALITY|fish dishes
as bfc does n't take reservations you almost always have to wait by the bar - and be abused by the front of house staff until you are seated , which can be over an hour later !	RESTAURANT#MISCELLANEOUS|bfc	SERVICE#GENERAL|front of house staff	SERVICE#GENERAL|null
the frizzy retro girl ( with winged/ dame edna glasses ) will yell at you if you try to order a drink .	SERVICE#GENERAL|girl
i was almost amused by the fact that she was turning away customers at 9pm on a friday night because she `` had a bbq to go to '' that night - wtf ? ?	SERVICE#GENERAL|null
i 'd be horrified if my staff were turning away customers so early and so rudely !	SERVICE#GENERAL|staff
there 's another girl who i ca n't describe , she is about 5'6 '' with brown hair , who eavesdrops on your conversation and chimes in - except she only hears the last part of what you said , so her uninvited opinions are often out of context and nothing to do with what you 're *really* talking about .	SERVICE#GENERAL|girl
i 'm a friendly person , so i would n't mind had she not been so nasty and gotten so personal .	SERVICE#GENERAL|null
again , i 'd be super upset if that were my employee .	SERVICE#GENERAL|null
considering you will spend at least $ 60 a head , i expect better service .	SERVICE#GENERAL|service	RESTAURANT#PRICES|null
so , if you 're walking by and thinking about dining , you might want to see who 's going to be seating you first ...	SERVICE#GENERAL|null

this guy refused to seat her and she left , followed shortly by the four of us , but not before i told him that in my 40 years of world travel , including paris , that i had never seen such a display of bad behavior by a frontman in a restaurant .	SERVICE#GENERAL|frontman
his response was smug , arrogant , and condescending , totally consistent with his deportment on display all evening .	SERVICE#GENERAL|null
a word to the wise : you ca n't dine here and disturb the maitre-d 's sense of `` table turnover '' , as whacked as it is , or else .	SERVICE#GENERAL|maitre-d

without the wait or attitude , i would probably go back , but there are just too many other restaurants in brooklyn that are as good or better and do n't make me jump through hoops .
