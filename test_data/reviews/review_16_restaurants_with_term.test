– this past weekend had great weather for san francisco standards .
so for the 'after beach excursion ' , we thought we would end the day on a high note and make the trip across the street from the beach to park chalet .
the restaurant was busy , however there were a few tables open .
we put out name down and although there were open tables we were told that it 'd be a 30 minute wait .	SERVICE#GENERAL|null
so here we are , my wife , 3 year old daughter and i trying to pass the time by hanging out in the front of the building ( where the murals and artifacts are ) .
30 minutes went by and sure enough the pager buzzer went off .
we went back to the restaurant and low and behold , we were seated at one of the tables that was available 30 minutes ago ! !	SERVICE#GENERAL|null
logic behind that ?
none that i can think of .	SERVICE#GENERAL|null
we put in our order and although we ordered 4 appetizers , the food did n't arrive until 45 minutes later ... with our main course .	SERVICE#GENERAL|null
um so now what are appetizers for ? ? ?	SERVICE#GENERAL|null
oh i forgot to mention that they do n't have bread service .	SERVICE#GENERAL|null
its a good thing my daughter had some snacks in her lunch bag .
my wife also ordered a teapot of hot water ( she had a sore throat ) and i guess that since it was only water , it was n't a priority for them to actually bring it .	SERVICE#GENERAL|null
in other words , if they are n't making $ $ off of you then you do n't rate high on their 'service scale ' .	SERVICE#GENERAL|service
food wise , its ok but a bit pricey for what you get considering the restaurant is n't a fancy place .	FOOD#QUALITY|food	RESTAURANT#PRICES|restaurant	AMBIENCE#GENERAL|restaurant
the upside of the restaurant ?
if i needed to name some they would include the location to the beach or golden gate park .	LOCATION#GENERAL|location
its great if you spent the day there and did n't want to drive to eat .	LOCATION#GENERAL|null
parking is reasonably good , they have their own lot and you can park in the park nearby .	RESTAURANT#MISCELLANEOUS|null

after one member of our party had been bumped repeatedly by a waitress , a polite request that he not be bumped sent the waitress into an abusive rant .	SERVICE#GENERAL|waitress
a brief conversation with the manager at the end of the meal was the greatest disappointment -- to say we had been `` blown off '' would be an understatement .	SERVICE#GENERAL|manager
the manager continually interrupted with `` is there anything else i can do for you ? `` , a strange comment because she had hardly listened , let alone responded to our expression of disappointment at our experience .	SERVICE#GENERAL|manager
she promised to speak to the waitress who had flown off in a rage , but we could hardly take her promise seriously , seeing as she had n't bothered to get the waitresses name .	SERVICE#GENERAL|null

late night dinning with exeptional food .	FOOD#QUALITY|food
– i did n't want to go there because of the reviews and prices i saw on the internet .
that was the last night in vegas and was too late and most of the restaurant were closing - so we walked in the check the place .
we were seated right away , the table was private and nice .	SERVICE#GENERAL|null	AMBIENCE#GENERAL|table
the service was exceptional - sometime there was a feeling that we were served by the army of friendly waiters .	SERVICE#GENERAL|service	SERVICE#GENERAL|waiters
the food was very good , filet mignon was probably the best i 've ever try .	FOOD#QUALITY|food	FOOD#QUALITY|filet mignon
the portions are big though , so do not order too much .	FOOD#STYLE_OPTIONS|portions

i have a but here - there was a bathroom attendant in the restroom which was odd .	RESTAURANT#MISCELLANEOUS|restroom
the bathroom itself is very small with two toilets and only one sink , the girl was staying totally on the way hanging out paper towels from the dispenser .	RESTAURANT#MISCELLANEOUS|bathroom
there were 3 bottles of perfume on the sink and the line of girls trying to use the sink .
i felt ackward and next time went to the casino bathroom .	RESTAURANT#MISCELLANEOUS|null

- mediocre service/quality	SERVICE#GENERAL|service
– this review is for the southglen location which is not listed in citysearch : i wish this review would make a difference enough for it to be addressed by management but snooze has people climbing over each other for a chance to eat at this overpriced restaurant with mediocre food and service , so this review as well as the other negative ones for their larimer location will go unaddressed .
the presentation of snooze is excellent and it is one of those places that you feel more sophisticated just for being there ; but peel back the layers and you have an overpriced ihop with a high brow menu .	AMBIENCE#GENERAL|snooze	FOOD#STYLE_OPTIONS|menu	RESTAURANT#PRICES|snooze
to start off , approximately 8-10 oz of orange juice will cost you $ 3 .	DRINKS#PRICES|orange juice
they serve it in a tall , skinny hour-glass shaped glass to disguise the fact that you a getting a small juice at the price of a half gallon in a supermarket .	DRINKS#STYLE_OPTIONS|juice	DRINKS#PRICES|juice
i should have just asked for the check when i saw that ; but their menu was so unique that i continued .	FOOD#STYLE_OPTIONS|menu
the pancakes were certainly inventive but $ 8.50 for 3 - 6 '' pancakes ( one of them was more like 5 '' ) in the pancake flight ( sample of 3 different pancakes ) is well over-priced .	FOOD#STYLE_OPTIONS|pancakes	FOOD#PRICES|pancakes	FOOD#STYLE_OPTIONS|pancakes
the pancakes should be larger ( at least 8 '' ) to justify the expense even with the unique offerings .	FOOD#STYLE_OPTIONS|pancakes	FOOD#PRICES|pancakes
the flavors were good but i have had far better pancakes at a german pancake specialty restaurant that were a little cheaper but significantly larger .
on my meal i had to send back my eggs for a simple request of breaking the yokes before cooking , and would have had to send them back again if i had n't rejected the meal all together .	FOOD#QUALITY|eggs	FOOD#QUALITY|meal
i rejected it because in the process of attempting to fix the eggs they broke something else in the dish and i was too frustrated to continue .	FOOD#QUALITY|dish
to their credit they removed the dish from the check ; but no manager stopped by to ask what the problem was .	SERVICE#GENERAL|manager	SERVICE#GENERAL|null
in the end our check came to $ 27 for 4 small pancakes , a breakfast burrito , an orange juice and an iced tea ( i had water ) .	FOOD#STYLE_OPTIONS|pancakes	FOOD#PRICES|pancakes	FOOD#PRICES|breakfast burrito	DRINKS#PRICES|orange juice	DRINKS#PRICES|iced tea
this was 2 times what the same meal would have cost at le peep .
snooze provided an inventive pancake offering , but le peep would have provided better service and quality .
much more than just a great view !	LOCATION#GENERAL|view	RESTAURANT#GENERAL|null
– i am exceedingly pleased to report that my dinner at ray 's boathouse last friday completely exceeded my expectations .	RESTAURANT#GENERAL|ray 's boathouse
ray 's is something of a seattle institution , but given its gorgeous sound views , i had suspected that the accolades were more due to the scenery than to the food and service .	LOCATION#GENERAL|sound views
imagine my happy surprise upon finding that the views are only the third-best thing about ray 's !	LOCATION#GENERAL|views	RESTAURANT#GENERAL|ray 's
to start things off , our lovely server brooke was quickly on hand to take my drink order .	SERVICE#GENERAL|brooke
my party of two was feeling particularly ambitious , and we splurged on the shilshole sampler ... a beautiful assortment of enormous white gulf prawns , smoked albacore tuna , ray 's fantastic manila clams seasoned with dill , scallops in a tasty soy dressing , and a tiny pile of dungeness crab atop a sublime butter sauce .

our server continued to be attentive throughout the night , but i did remain puzzled by one issue : who thinks that ray 's is an appropriate place to take young children for dinner ?	SERVICE#GENERAL|server	RESTAURANT#MISCELLANEOUS|ray 's
two rascally kids were seated near us for the first part of our dinner ... they were replaced by a delightful preteen who pretended to gag every time seafood was mentioned at her table .	RESTAURANT#MISCELLANEOUS|null
given that ray 's is a seafood restaurant ... well , you get the idea ...
all considered , i have to say that ray 's boathouse is deserving of its title as a seattle institution .	RESTAURANT#GENERAL|ray 's boathouse
while i could have done without the youth who shared the evening with us , our wonderful server and food made the experience a very positive one .	SERVICE#GENERAL|server	FOOD#QUALITY|food	RESTAURANT#MISCELLANEOUS|null
