i will have to do more research before checking out new places based on diners , drive-ins and dives reviews .
i noice most reviews mention the bad service .
the food was ok , but the service was so poor that the food was cold buy the time everyone in my party was served .	FOOD#QUALITY	SERVICE#GENERAL
even then , the order was not correct and we were still waiting for a couple items .	SERVICE#GENERAL
we had a very hard time getting the waitress ' attention and finally had to get up and go inside to speak to a manager .	SERVICE#GENERAL
as it turns out the owner was seated right next to us and when he came over to check on our problems was very dismissive and offered a token 20 % discount on our bill .	SERVICE#GENERAL
when the bill came , he only took the discount off the food and not the drinks .	SERVICE#GENERAL
it was clear he didn’t really care .	SERVICE#GENERAL
with so many great breakfast/lunch places in so cal , this one is not worth the wait or any extra effort to visit .
avoid the place	RESTAURANT#GENERAL

i made my 1st trip to the restaurant after finding their webpage online .
when i got there i sat up stairs where the atmosphere was cozy & the service was horrible !	AMBIENCE#GENERAL	SERVICE#GENERAL
i waited for 10-15 minutes for service ordered a beer & was never served again .	SERVICE#GENERAL
after sitting there with my empty glass for over 20 minutes i left .	SERVICE#GENERAL
i went home & looked them up online again where i discovered there is a link for a give away that does n't work so emailed the restaurant about the non existent service & deceptive link .	RESTAURANT#MISCELLANEOUS

best chinese food i have tasted in a long time	FOOD#QUALITY
– we got a groupon for pagoda and decided to try it on a thursday night .
there was a guy playing the piano and singing at the bar area which was separate from the dinning area .
you can easily hear him though so it was a pleasant sound and not overbearing .	AMBIENCE#GENERAL
the ambiance of the restaurant was nice and good for fine dinning .	AMBIENCE#GENERAL
not too fine thought that you feel uncomfortable and have to dress up .	AMBIENCE#GENERAL
the staff was very nice and courteous and obviously chinese .	SERVICE#GENERAL
we ordered the honey walnut prawns which we always order at every chinese restaurant to determine the quality of food .
first off , the food came fast and all together : ) i like that ... i hate the pretentiousness of things coming in one after the other .	SERVICE#GENERAL
so about the prawns , they were fresh and had a slight crispiness about the batter ... soooo good ... the walnuts were cut in smaller pieces and very crunchy and tasty .	FOOD#QUALITY	FOOD#QUALITY	FOOD#QUALITY

– this past weekend had great weather for san francisco standards .
so for the 'after beach excursion ' , we thought we would end the day on a high note and make the trip across the street from the beach to park chalet .
the restaurant was busy , however there were a few tables open .
we put out name down and although there were open tables we were told that it 'd be a 30 minute wait .	SERVICE#GENERAL
so here we are , my wife , 3 year old daughter and i trying to pass the time by hanging out in the front of the building ( where the murals and artifacts are ) .
30 minutes went by and sure enough the pager buzzer went off .
we went back to the restaurant and low and behold , we were seated at one of the tables that was available 30 minutes ago ! !	SERVICE#GENERAL
logic behind that ?
none that i can think of .	SERVICE#GENERAL
we put in our order and although we ordered 4 appetizers , the food did n't arrive until 45 minutes later ... with our main course .	SERVICE#GENERAL
um so now what are appetizers for ? ? ?	SERVICE#GENERAL
oh i forgot to mention that they do n't have bread service .	SERVICE#GENERAL
its a good thing my daughter had some snacks in her lunch bag .
my wife also ordered a teapot of hot water ( she had a sore throat ) and i guess that since it was only water , it was n't a priority for them to actually bring it .	SERVICE#GENERAL
in other words , if they are n't making $ $ off of you then you do n't rate high on their 'service scale ' .	SERVICE#GENERAL
food wise , its ok but a bit pricey for what you get considering the restaurant is n't a fancy place .	FOOD#QUALITY	RESTAURANT#PRICES	AMBIENCE#GENERAL
the upside of the restaurant ?
if i needed to name some they would include the location to the beach or golden gate park .	LOCATION#GENERAL
its great if you spent the day there and did n't want to drive to eat .	LOCATION#GENERAL
parking is reasonably good , they have their own lot and you can park in the park nearby .	RESTAURANT#MISCELLANEOUS
another plus is the open feel of the restaurant with glass walls on all sides .	AMBIENCE#GENERAL	AMBIENCE#GENERAL

while this diner had reasonably good food , the restaurant staff seemed completely indifferent to our presence , and this attitude was reflected in the lack of service .	FOOD#QUALITY	SERVICE#GENERAL
as part of a small party of four , our food was dropped off without comment ;	SERVICE#GENERAL
any further needs we may have had could not have been met since no one stopped by the table .	SERVICE#GENERAL
when we finally were able to flag someone down , it was someone entirely different from the person who had dropped off the food , who was also not the same person who had taken our order .	SERVICE#GENERAL
after one member of our party had been bumped repeatedly by a waitress , a polite request that he not be bumped sent the waitress into an abusive rant .	SERVICE#GENERAL
a brief conversation with the manager at the end of the meal was the greatest disappointment -- to say we had been `` blown off '' would be an understatement .	SERVICE#GENERAL
the manager continually interrupted with `` is there anything else i can do for you ? `` , a strange comment because she had hardly listened , let alone responded to our expression of disappointment at our experience .	SERVICE#GENERAL
she promised to speak to the waitress who had flown off in a rage , but we could hardly take her promise seriously , seeing as she had n't bothered to get the waitresses name .	SERVICE#GENERAL
in short , schooner or later could n't have cared less about our being at their establishment .	SERVICE#GENERAL
next time we will go somewhere else , or try other restaurants close by like mimi 's cafe and claim jumper .

it was steamed and tossed with garlic .
the 9 oz steak came next and it tasted great , at least initially .	FOOD#QUALITY
the steak was done to my exact liking ( medium rare ) and was nice and juicy .	FOOD#QUALITY
it ? s served with either a peppercorn sauce or red wine reduction , though both were indistinguishable in taste .	FOOD#QUALITY	FOOD#QUALITY
though , one thing i realized later on was that the restaurant either used msg or a meat tenderizer on the steak .	FOOD#QUALITY

finally , the homemade donut holes were served for desert .
they came in their own nifty take out box and with some homemade frosting ; very light and not-too-sweet .	FOOD#QUALITY
