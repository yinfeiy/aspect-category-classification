literally , it stays much cooler than my old macbook pro .
the old unibody macbook pro could fry an egg after a while .
got this on black friday with a very good discount and could n't be happier .	LAPTOP#PRICE	LAPTOP#GENERAL

if you are afraid of it not having a disc player please do n't be .	LAPTOP#DESIGN_FEATURES
after not having a disc player i have actually noticed that i never used this disc play in my old laptop either .
however if you really need a disc player apple sells one that connects to your usb port .
i love the new high retina display , and because this computer lacks a disc player it makes it significantly lighter .	DISPLAY#QUALITY	LAPTOP#DESIGN_FEATURES

a disk drive with buttons on it ! ! ! ! ! !	OPTICAL_DRIVES#DESIGN_FEATURES

be aware of price differences when purchasing computer .
price was higher when purchased on mac when compared to price showing on pc when i bought this product .
amazon has since fixed the price to show the same , but it is now higher on both platforms ( but price is the same now ) .
my new laptop is great .	LAPTOP#GENERAL
it has so much more speed and the screen is very sharp .	LAPTOP#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE	DISPLAY#QUALITY

i wanted a laptop on a budget just for my university teaching needs ( making word documents , powerpoints , excels , pdfs - office is not included ) .
this laptop is fine for those applications and basic websurfing .	LAPTOP#MISCELLANEOUS
the speakers are fairly basic , so this is probably not the computer to buy if your main aim is streaming music or watching movies .	MULTIMEDIA_DEVICES#GENERAL	LAPTOP#MISCELLANEOUS
the touchpad is a little & quot ; clunky & quot ; for my taste ; i use a small external mouse with laptops in any event .	MOUSE#DESIGN_FEATURES

this is early days for a review , since i took delivery of this only today !
however , a few things are immediately occurring to me i had read the other reviews here on amazon , but decided the specs and appearance looked good enough to go ahead .	LAPTOP#DESIGN_FEATURES
well , my first impressions are that its ok , it certainly boots up quickly ( thanks ssd ! ) , and from the limited use so far ( no games ) its fast enough in normal usage .	LAPTOP#GENERAL	LAPTOP#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE	HARD_DISC#GENERAL
it certainly looks nice , but that nice dark blue top is a fingerprint magnet as others have pointed out .	LAPTOP#DESIGN_FEATURES	LAPTOP#QUALITY
also i have found the touch pad to be awkward to use ( could be i am pressing too hard perhaps ) , and the screen is well underwhelming .	MOUSE#USABILITY	DISPLAY#GENERAL
to be honest i am a little disappointed and considering returning it .	LAPTOP#GENERAL
if that changes i will add an update to this .
this is a horrible laptop .	LAPTOP#GENERAL
within a day of usage , it already slowed down significantly , virus entered the system right away .	LAPTOP#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE	LAPTOP#QUALITY
it 's got a very slow process , keys do n't respond fast as macbooks .

never had any issues , no frustrations just great easy wireless , all in one fun !	LAPTOP#GENERAL	LAPTOP#CONNECTIVITY

i am pleased with my decision , however i have only had this for a few weeks .	LAPTOP#GENERAL
there are a few things i am dissappointed with though .	LAPTOP#GENERAL
only 2 usb ports .	LAPTOP#DESIGN_FEATURES
most windows laptops have 2 to 4 or more .
no hdmi port .	LAPTOP#DESIGN_FEATURES
most windows laptops have at least 1 .
the headphones jack is a combo jack for the headphones and microphone .	MULTIMEDIA_DEVICES#DESIGN_FEATURES
not a big deal for me , but if you skype a lot or are gaming a regular headphone set with a separate jack for the headphone sound and microphone input will not work on a mac .	MULTIMEDIA_DEVICES#DESIGN_FEATURES	LAPTOP#USABILITY
these are about twice the price of an equivilant windows machine so it was a tough decision , but like i said i am pleased so far ... ..
as a student majoring computer science , i really fell in love with this laptop .	LAPTOP#GENERAL
what is there not to like ?
it 's 15.6 inches , which for me is not too big nor too small .	LAPTOP#DESIGN_FEATURES
it has the latest i7 cpu with a gtx 950m for gpu , which makes this laptop blazing fast ( boots up in under 5 seconds , with the help of the ssd of course ) .	CPU#DESIGN_FEATURES	GRAPHICS#DESIGN_FEATURES	LAPTOP#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE	HARD_DISC#DESIGN_FEATURES
- it has 256gb ssd which is just enough for my os , games , documents , and anything in between .	HARD_DISC#DESIGN_FEATURES
it also has an extra bay for an extra hdd if you wish to add one .	LAPTOP#DESIGN_FEATURES
- it 's not touchscreen !	DISPLAY#DESIGN_FEATURES
how i hate laptops with touchscreen .
i do n't have to pay extra for what i hate , i mean seriously , who types with their laptops and occasionally reaches out to the screen to tap it ?
- its keyboard is nicely arranged , silent , and back-lit which is nice , but what i do n't like about it is the material attracts oil from your fingers .	KEYBOARD#DESIGN_FEATURES	KEYBOARD#QUALITY	KEYBOARD#QUALITY
i have to clean it regularly for it to stay looking good .	KEYBOARD#QUALITY
- this laptop is so silent , its fans only kick in when the laptop is under heavy load , thanks to the 5th generation intel core which draws less power , thus less heat .	LAPTOP#QUALITY	FANS_COOLING#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE	CPU#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE
- it 's comfortable to have it on my lap , because the weight is evenly distributed to he laptop 's body and not accumulated on the screen like most & amp ; # 34 ; hybrid & amp ; # 34 ; ones do .
- it can run games really well .	LAPTOP#MISCELLANEOUS
well , not really well .	LAPTOP#MISCELLANEOUS
mobas like dota 2 and smite can be run on max quality settings with 60 fps or more .	DISPLAY#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE
medium settings on titles like tomb raider for it to be acceptable ( 60 fps is the minimum acceptable fps # pcmasterrace ) .	DISPLAY#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE

the magnetic lid and charger is cool and battery indicator on the side is cool .	LAPTOP#DESIGN_FEATURES	POWER_SUPPLY#DESIGN_FEATURES
used my ir remote with it and was kinda glad i did n't buy the retina display or the air .
i do n't have any technical pearls to share .
i can provide a review from a layman 's viewpoint .
this is my first apple laptop .
i currently own a apple desktop which is usually used to watch movies in my studio .
i have not used my ipad since my mac purchase .
the mac is light and so compact i thought i would regret not buying a retina display , not in the least the mac pro works just fine .	LAPTOP#DESIGN_FEATURES	DISPLAY#QUALITY	LAPTOP#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE
my main use of the mac will be keeping inventory on my jewelry supplies .
once i complete a jewelry piece taking photos and keeping track of sales .
along with email and playing angry birds .
the os is easy , and offers all kinds of surprises .	OS#USABILITY	OS#MISCELLANEOUS
i 've been using apple 's since 1992 and this is the fastest and best one i 've had .	LAPTOP#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE	LAPTOP#GENERAL
i wanted an i7 chip and i wanted one i could still work on .
the retinal display laptops do n't allow for much tinkering .
i wanted to be able to add my own memory , add a second hard drive , and in the future replace the battery when it begins to fail .
this mac allows all of that .	LAPTOP#USABILITY
i do n't game a lot so i do n't need a super hd display ; for that i use my appletv to display on my 52 & amp ; # 34 ; tv .
this is very fast , high performance computer .	LAPTOP#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE

i love it and would recommend it to everyone who is tired of the constant attention pc 's require .
out of all the laptops i have owned , this is by far the best !	LAPTOP#GENERAL
i was considering buying the air , but in reality , this one has a more powerful performance and seems much more convenient , even though it 's about .20 inch thicker and 2 lbs heavier .
i 'm not sure if it was covered in the description , but it does have a backlit keyboard and i 'm getting about an 8 hour battery life on one charge ( except i do n't use this for games or videos , which obviously would drain the battery faster ) .

my daughter 's macbook air battery bulged deforming the keyboard several days ago .	BATTERY#QUALITY

i could not believe they did not consider the battery as defective so i went to the apple store myself and asked for a manager .	SUPPORT#QUALITY

apple does n't cover battery expansion under any circumstances not even under their apple care .	SUPPORT#QUALITY
the battery is simply considered 'consumable ' and not covered .	SUPPORT#QUALITY
i asked the manager if he feels comfortable with me posting the picture of the macbook air on the internet with the description that apple does n't consider the product defective .	SUPPORT#QUALITY
his reply astonished me , looking down at me behind his thick glasses he said : 'make sure you have your facts straight before you smear !	SUPPORT#QUALITY
they will contact you . '
he did n't specify who are 'they ' but from the tone of his voice and his 6'5 ' posture it indicated something between the swat team and a bunch of lawyers .	SUPPORT#QUALITY
here is my take on all of this , the business model apple pushes right now is to get some cheap junk from china , hire a bunch of cheerleaders straight out of high school , call them geniuses , and bully everybody who complains about their product .	COMPANY#GENERAL

i purchased this laptop back in june 2015 after doing a lot of research on different laptops i was interested in .
while i have only ever owned hp laptops , i made sure to look into other brands , including asus , dell , and microsoft .
however , the hp envy has definitely met all of my expectations and more .	LAPTOP#GENERAL
i have been thoroughly impressed with my purchase thus far and do not regret purchasing it at all .	LAPTOP#GENERAL
while the price may seem high , it is worth every penny with its many perks .	LAPTOP#PRICE	LAPTOP#GENERAL
the pros : a ton of storage space- this laptop comes with 8gb of memory and a 1 tb ( 1000gb ) hard drive .	MEMORY#DESIGN_FEATURES	HARD_DISC#DESIGN_FEATURES
that is plenty of space for your laptop , which really comes in handy for college students and computer gamers .	HARD_DISC#DESIGN_FEATURES
i really enjoy having all of the extra space , especially coming from a laptop with only 500gb of hard drive space .
2-in-1 capability- the ease of switching this laptop into a tablet is a huge plus .	LAPTOP#DESIGN_FEATURES	LAPTOP#USABILITY
if you are looking to get a 2-in-1 laptop , this is the laptop you should consider .	LAPTOP#MISCELLANEOUS
i love the flexibility of being able to fold it over like a tent and watch movies , without having the keyboard in the way of things .	LAPTOP#USABILITY
however , the physical keyboard is much nicer than the detachable ones found on other laptops and tablets .
i find it much easier to type on and much more durable .	KEYBOARD#USABILITY	KEYBOARD#QUALITY
battery life- my battery life is really good with this laptop and i have had no problems with it thus far .	BATTERY#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE
i can usually go about 10 hours before i get down to 10 % battery life .	BATTERY#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE
my last laptop had terrible battery life , lasting only about an hour on a full charge , so this is n't too shabby at all for a laptop .
the cons : no disc drive- call me old fashioned , but i still enjoy listening to physical cds and uploading them to itunes .	LAPTOP#DESIGN_FEATURES
however , i can no longer do this because this laptop does not contain a disc drive .	LAPTOP#DESIGN_FEATURES
while it is entirely possible to buy a disc drive , i do not feel like it is something i absolutely need .
if you are an avid cd listener though or want to watch dvds from your laptop , i would suggest buying the separate disc drive .
overall , i definitely would recommend this product to any college student that is in the market for a new laptop .	LAPTOP#GENERAL
the touchscreen and 2-in-1 capability is a huge bonus and it is really easy to carry around to your classes .	DISPLAY#DESIGN_FEATURES	LAPTOP#DESIGN_FEATURES	LAPTOP#PORTABILITY
it also is nice to be able to play candy crush or angry birds when in between classes straight from your laptop .	LAPTOP#MISCELLANEOUS

i 'm actually writing this review on my new macbook and i love it !	LAPTOP#GENERAL
the seller was great and i had my computer within 2 days .
the computer it self is amazing .	LAPTOP#GENERAL
it is an older model , so know that upfront , but it is everything i was looking for .	LAPTOP#MISCELLANEOUS	LAPTOP#GENERAL
i wanted a laptop that had a cd drive , since most new laptops do not have one , a laptop with an actual hard drive , since the new macbooks do not , and i wanted to get away from pcs .
i actually spent $ 600 on a pc before i bought this macbook and returned it with 24 hours because it was slow , and i could not stand windows 10 .
from the moment i received this macbook it was like a dream come true .	LAPTOP#GENERAL
it is a little sluggish , which was to be expected with the 4gb ram , but even at its sluggish it is faster than the pc i bought .
i know once i upgrade the ram to 8gb it will pick up a lot .	MEMORY#DESIGN_FEATURES
as an added bonus i plan on upgraded to 16gb down the road , but 8 will do for now .
the price for the ram is about $ 80 so this lap top is still cheaper than a brand new macbook .
also , if after reading some reviews and doing some research i found out that this laptop is easily upgradable and easy to work on which is another big plus .	LAPTOP#USABILITY
so long story short , if you want an oldie but a goodie this is your laptop .	LAPTOP#GENERAL
i know people were complaining that it is n't the newest model , but it all depends on what you are looking for .	LAPTOP#MISCELLANEOUS
it 's the perfect size for someone who is using a laptop for school or everyday use , and while it is a little heaver than the macbook air , at 5ish pounds , its really not that bad .
i highly recommend ! !	LAPTOP#GENERAL

there are a lot of things a laptop can do these days , and if you ask me , many of them should be automatically included in every laptop , no matter what .
- do you remember when computers did n't have cameras on them ?
no ? ok we 're looking at a generation gap ( s ) here , but yes , back in the day , computers did n't have cameras on them .
now , it 's unthinkable to buy a computer without one .
this asus you 're looking at right here , and that i 'm typing on right now , has one .	LAPTOP#DESIGN_FEATURES
- with that being said , for the price ( $ 800 ! ) , you get a nice fast laptop , but if you ask me , it 's missing some things that i feel should be automatically included :	LAPTOP#PRICE	LAPTOP#GENERAL	LAPTOP#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE	LAPTOP#DESIGN_FEATURES

i just bought this macbook pro a few weeks ago , and the user interface was so simple i got used to my computer in a matter of days , rather than the year it took for me to master microsoft windows 7 .
boot time is super fast , around anywhere from 35 seconds to 1 minute .	LAPTOP#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE
apps launch super fast , and the 500gb hdd is more than sufficient .	SOFTWARE#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE	HARD_DISC#DESIGN_FEATURES

furthermore , mac os x mountain lion 's gate keeper prevents the user from downloading malware and trojans , which keep your data safe and your computer running at optimum speed .	OS#QUALITY	LAPTOP#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE
the keys on the keyboard are evenly spaced and are back-lit , which make it easy to use at night and for speed writing ( typing ? ) .	KEYBOARD#DESIGN_FEATURES	KEYBOARD#USABILITY
overall , the screen resolution , though non-retina , is sufficient for normal web browsing and work .	DISPLAY#QUALITY
i still do n't get why retina displays are standard on most new ios devices , but are only available on the macbook pro with retina display ( total cheapskate ! ) .
the thunderbolt port is awesome !	PORTS#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE

us 3.0 comes with the mbp and has transfer rates of up to 5gbps .	LAPTOP#DESIGN_FEATURES	PORTS#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE
other ports include firewire 800 , gigabit ethernet , magsafe port , microphone jack .	LAPTOP#DESIGN_FEATURES

the glass track pad is large enough for apple 's highly acclaimed multi-touch gestures for scrolling through web pages with two fingers , zooming in on certain parts of certain apps by double tapping with two fingers , accessing launchpad by pinching with five fingers and using mission control by swiping up with four fingers .

you can also buy one of apple 's magic mice , which connect to your mac using bluetooth , and also allows you to use certain multi-touch gestures such as zoom and scroll .

*users without an optical drive can skip the installation of microsoft office and head to the next section*
to install the software , simply insert the disc provided in the package into the optical drive and open and install all the files .
enter your code printed on the back of your cd sleeve when prompted .

the mac app store and itunes store are phenomenal .	SOFTWARE#GENERAL
the mac app store is your one-stop shop for mac software , though you can also download software online at your own risk .	SOFTWARE#GENERAL
there are currently around 10,000 apps on the app store ( and counting ... ) , and billions of songs available for download fro the itunes store .	SOFTWARE#DESIGN_FEATURES
itunes is also you default ( and also your only ) media player besides dvd player , or any other media players you may come across on the internet .
itunes is one of the better media players available on the market with it 's simple to use user interface .	SOFTWARE#GENERAL	SOFTWARE#USABILITY
users switching from a pc will definitely prefer itunes to microsoft 's windows media player .
overall , the high price of the macbook pro may convince users to buy a cheaper windows pc instead .
but remember , you are paying a high premium for a product with better build quality and high quality software , which is a joy to work with , considering that you can finally work in peace without having to worry about the millions of windows viruses out in the wild attacking countless careless and oblivious pc users .

the simple look of icons and format makes it easy to navigate through programs and download files .	OS#DESIGN_FEATURES	LAPTOP#USABILITY
the only issue i had was with the harddrive .	HARD_DISC#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE
the harddrive crashed and i thought i had lost the whole computer .	HARD_DISC#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE
luckily that was not the case .
replacing the harddrive in this laptop is extremely easy , a couple screws on the back to remove the backplate and the harddrive is pretty much plug and play .	LAPTOP#USABILITY
i purchased a seagate solid state harddrive , the same kind that apple installs originally .
and apple was happy to install the latest osx for free !	SUPPORT#QUALITY
you wont be disappointed with this computer !	LAPTOP#GENERAL
i have been a mac person since 1984 .
i do n't want to run a computer ; i want to use a computer .
this md101ll/a handles very much like my imac .
it 's just a matter of getting used to the touch-pad commands .	MOUSE#USABILITY
thankfully i have earphones and an external amplifier for audio ; the onboard speakers are just terrible .	MULTIMEDIA_DEVICES#GENERAL
but what should i expect from a unit that is this thin and this light ?	LAPTOP#DESIGN_FEATURES
the most disappointing purchase of my life !	LAPTOP#GENERAL
this is my first mac .
i received a dud and have had nothing but problems since right after i purchased this horrible machine .	LAPTOP#QUALITY	LAPTOP#GENERAL
within the first few months that i bought it , there was clearly a problem with the hard drive .	HARD_DISC#QUALITY
i had been in a training program and had only used word on it .
i went through all of the customer service options .
the online customer service was awful .	SUPPORT#QUALITY
gave me the runaround for an entire day and treated me like an imbecile .	SUPPORT#QUALITY
no one would ever answer my question as to why i could n't get another new macbook since this was clearly a factory error and my macbook was still under warranty .	SUPPORT#QUALITY
as a matter of fact , no matter how many times i asked that question , the employees i spoke purposely ignored it .	SUPPORT#QUALITY
they did n't say yes and they did n't say no , they just pretended that i never asked it , which was incredibly frustrating .	SUPPORT#QUALITY
i 've been to the & amp ; # 34 ; genius & amp ; # 34 ; bar several times ( they have been very nice ) .	SUPPORT#QUALITY
they have now basically replaced everything inside my machine , told me there was a problem with the hardware , so i now have a & amp ; # 34 ; refurbished & amp ; # 34 ; machine .	LAPTOP#QUALITY	HARDWARE#QUALITY
maybe i 'm not being reasonable , but i do n't feel that 's the same as a new computer because i did n't pay for a refurbished computer .	LAPTOP#MISCELLANEOUS
i still have weird freezing problems with it and it 's pretty slow , but it 's not pinpointed enough yet for me to take it in .	LAPTOP#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE
i had delusions of grandeur regarding apple 's & amp ; # 34 ; great customer service & amp ; # 34 ; and the & amp ; # 34 ; reliability of their machines & amp ; # 34 ; etc.. etc ... blah ... blah ...	SUPPORT#QUALITY	LAPTOP#QUALITY	COMPANY#GENERAL
i do n't love pcs , but every pc i 've ever owned has lasted longer than this macbook , which costs much more than any of those pcs .
i 'm sure most people 's macbooks work just fine , but fyi , if you get the factory dud , you 're stuck with it and no one at apple cares or will give a hoot about the money you threw away .	SUPPORT#QUALITY	COMPANY#GENERAL
i was a long time pc user .
not a geek or a wonk .
pc 's were just cheaper had more software and were ubiquitous .
i had an old laptop running windows xp that i used at home for email .
a couple office products and occasionally watched tv on .
with the eol of xp .
i had to decide if i was going to make a financial commitment to windows , upgrade , buy new , change .
i decided no ! enough was enough .
i was tired or hodge lodge of software products , security updates , malware , junk and endless upgrade trauma with windows .
i did upgrade my old pc to windows 7 , but i went with a macbook pro and i am very happy .
one os for this platform , no oem os paraphernalia and automatic updates .	LAPTOP#DESIGN_FEATURES	OS#DESIGN_FEATURES
i am happy with the feel the speed and the seamless transition to the mac !	LAPTOP#QUALITY	LAPTOP#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE	LAPTOP#USABILITY
i was told by my daughter that i was & amp ; # 34 ; stupid & amp ; # 34 ; for spending so much time on a pc just to make it run , when most of that & amp ; # 34 ; run stuff & amp ; # 34 ; is taken care of by apple ! .
i told her & amp ; # 34 ; real men & amp ; # 34 ; use pc 's because of the challenge it keeps you sharp technically .
her final response was & amp ; # 34 ; whatever & amp ; # 34 ; !
well she was right , whatever in the world took me so long to get a computer that just works .	LAPTOP#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE
i 'm no power user , but i have had no learning curve with the mac and i do n't do anything geeky enough forcing me to learn the os .	LAPTOP#USABILITY	OS#USABILITY
i did buy office 2008 for the mac at a very low price to migrate most of my work files for $ 64 and that was a steal in my opinion .	SOFTWARE#PRICE
otherwise i am happily a mac user .	LAPTOP#GENERAL	COMPANY#GENERAL
for a premium laptop sold in 2013 , the apple macbook pro ( 13 inch , base model ) is about as basic as it gets : no ssd , no discrete graphics , no 1080p display , and no touch screen .	LAPTOP#GENERAL	GRAPHICS#DESIGN_FEATURES	LAPTOP#DESIGN_FEATURES	DISPLAY#DESIGN_FEATURES
but apple does not pretend it has any of these .	COMPANY#GENERAL
what it does have is great reliability on the software side and hardware side , apple 's osx mountain lion , the sleek looks apple always delivers , reasonable specs , good battery life , nice keyboard , and excellent trackpad .

now , the question is , who is this computer for ?
those looking for a bargain laptop will shy away from the enormous price tag , and those who want to play the latest games do not ever use macs .	LAPTOP#PRICE	LAPTOP#MISCELLANEOUS
the average computer user will be served better by a macbook air , since it is faster ( for basic tasks ) , lighter , and has a higher-res antiglare screen .
the macbook pro 13.3 inch laptop is for those who want to use a mac , but value performance and upgradability over weight and screen resolution .	LAPTOP#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE	LAPTOP#USABILITY	LAPTOP#DESIGN_FEATURES	DISPLAY#QUALITY
this mac will last longer than any other simply because it is the easiest to upgrade and repair .	LAPTOP#QUALITY	LAPTOP#USABILITY
hard drives can be replaced , ram can be added as needed , and the internal battery can be replaced after losing its ability to hold a charge .	LAPTOP#USABILITY
the processor is roughly 15 % faster than the one inside the macbook air , which also extends this computer 's usable lifespan .
the fact that the screen is fairly low-res for the price ( mbp 13 has a res of 1280x800 , while other windows laptops have a res of 1600x900 for the same price ) , really detracts from my personal experience with the computer .
the retina display of my iphone 5 has indeed spoiled me , and apple should update the screen of the mbp 13 or bring down the price of the retina model .
this , added with the fact that the speed of the hard drive is very slow for the money , detracts from the computer 's value .	HARD_DISC#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE	LAPTOP#PRICE	LAPTOP#GENERAL
lowering the price by one hundred dollars would justify the hard drive and screen and make the computer a five-star purchase , but for the price , this is a four star ( good ) computer .	LAPTOP#PRICE	LAPTOP#GENERAL
those looking to drop $ 1200 on a new laptop will have to decide if the upgradability and processor performance is worth the money over the sleeker macbook air .
in addition , if mac osx is not something you enjoy using , then i would advise that you look elsewhere for a laptop .
tldr version : good , reliable laptop with mediocre screen and slow hard drive .	HARD_DISC#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE	DISPLAY#QUALITY	LAPTOP#QUALITY	LAPTOP#GENERAL
i am really sorry i bought this machine .	LAPTOP#GENERAL
i own a 13 ' air , a 15 ' macbook pro ( both prior generations ) .
i was shocked at how much worse this product has been since my first purchase .	LAPTOP#GENERAL
i have never been to a genius bar since my first purchase ( 1984 ) .
this machine has made me go there 5 times and has been nothing but a continuous problem .	LAPTOP#QUALITY	LAPTOP#GENERAL
finally , they are sending it in for a motherboard replacement .	MOTHERBOARD#QUALITY
( it 's a lemon ) .	LAPTOP#QUALITY
so , i 'm cooled on mac buys .	COMPANY#GENERAL
i guess those chinese workers really are unhappy .
update november 1 , 2012 ... on my last visit to the genius bar they sent the machine in to replace the motherboard .
it came back today .
they did not replace the motherboard .	SUPPORT#QUALITY
instead they 'tightened ' a loose wire .	SUPPORT#QUALITY
it also has a big new scratch on the top cover .	SUPPORT#QUALITY
i started it up and it still has the same problem i went in to fix .	SUPPORT#QUALITY
so i 'm going back to genius bar for visit # 6 .	SUPPORT#QUALITY
i think it may have to be 'apple do n't care ' instead of apple care .	SUPPORT#QUALITY	COMPANY#GENERAL
it was time to replace my 8 year old laptop and i decided to get a & amp ; # 34 ; fancy & amp ; # 34 ; mac book pro .
you get what you pay for , right ?	LAPTOP#PRICE	LAPTOP#GENERAL
wrong !
if you like your windows 7 , vista or even xp , just stick with it .
any of those are way simpler to use than apple 's mountain lion operating system .
mac is complicated and frustrating at moments .	OS#DESIGN_FEATURES	OS#USABILITY
i watched tutorials and that helped somewhat but not enough .	OS#USABILITY
i 'm a small business owner and a productivity aspect is very important to me .
windows operating system is a superior product by far .
it 's actually very obvious .
just look at a market share between the two concepts .
i should have known better .	LAPTOP#GENERAL
i hope you do n't make the same mistake ...	LAPTOP#GENERAL
when i first got the computer , i noticed the tracking pad was hard to click .	MOUSE#USABILITY
this was my first mac so i was n't familiar with how it was suppose to feel .
after using my friend 's computer i knew something was wrong .
i took my macbook to the apple store and they had to replace the battery after 1 month of use since it was swelling .	BATTERY#QUALITY
they tried to tell me that the battery was n't covered by the warranty and it costs about $ 150 to replace .	SUPPORT#QUALITY
they ended up not charging me .	SUPPORT#QUALITY
other than that battery issue and the battery life does not last too long , i 'm pretty happy with the computer .	BATTERY#QUALITY	BATTERY#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE	LAPTOP#GENERAL
i 'm a designer turned front-end developer and this computer is unusable for front-end development .	LAPTOP#MISCELLANEOUS
i have a production pc which was much less expensive and way underspeced compared to this mac .
opening photoshop takes fooooooorrrever , as do all programs that do not begin with an 'i ' .	SOFTWARE#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE	LAPTOP#USABILITY
the free upgrade to mountain lion failed .	OS#MISCELLANEOUS
failed .
it tried to boot up and the screen just flashed over and over and over again .	DISPLAY#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE
before and after i resolved that issue , i saw the damn 'beachball ' all the time as the computer tries to figure out what the hell it 's doing while i wait for it .	LAPTOP#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE
i spend so much time waiting for it .	LAPTOP#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE
although its display is bright and vibrant the os so unusable for work , i have moved back to the older , and still over performing pc .
the only thing i use this computer for is a safari tester , and safari is awful compared to chrome .
i ca n't believe people like these computers .	LAPTOP#GENERAL	COMPANY#GENERAL
now that they are not virus free ( [ ... ] l ) i see absolutely no benefit to apple products as they are slower , more expensive , and do not last as long .	LAPTOP#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE	LAPTOP#PRICE	LAPTOP#QUALITY	COMPANY#GENERAL

my hp seemed great at first , then the problems started ... ..wireless adapter would just & quot ; disappear & quot ; and the system said it did n't have a network card .	LAPTOP#GENERAL	LAPTOP#CONNECTIVITY

my bud had the same problem .
the aftermarket battery seems better than hp 's .
when i had a boot up issue , the hp recovery did n't work .	LAPTOP#MISCELLANEOUS
the disks i made would n't work ... ..hp support stated & quot ; we 're a hardware company , not a software company. & quot ;	LAPTOP#MISCELLANEOUS	SUPPORT#QUALITY
microsoft support says to contact the manufacturer ... .hp .
then there was a power cord recall ... .hp never notified us ... ..and we did register ... ... never again .	COMPANY#GENERAL
i had issues with acer , but my dell 's just seem to keep going .
i switched to an apple airbook and love it .
fewer security issues , no he said , she said between the software and hardware companies , and it works ... ... .
btw , i have far fewer security hack issues , too .
i do n't have the inclination or time to devote to a companies tech support , search functions , or hold times ... ..dropped the hp and never looked back .	LAPTOP#GENERAL	COMPANY#GENERAL
i gave this product 5 stars because i have been looking for a macbook pro for a long time and i found it here for a wonderful price .	LAPTOP#PRICE	LAPTOP#GENERAL
i have used this product for only 2 days , but i ca n't wait to use it more .	LAPTOP#GENERAL
i really like mac/apple products because of their operating system .	OS#GENERAL	COMPANY#GENERAL
i have been a linux ( ubuntu and fedora ) user for a while because windows does n't appeal to me and it is similar to ubuntu and fedora but with trackpad gestures , notification center , and i can run itunes ( i could n't get it to run on linux ) .
i can tweet and use facebook from the sidebar which is really nice .	OS#USABILITY
i also like i have the option to push calendars , photos , and contacts to an ipad , ipod touch , or iphone ( if i had any of those ) .	OS#USABILITY
the only thing i have had trouble with so far is transferring music to itunes which i would have liked to do though & amp ; # 34 ; home sharing & amp ; # 34 ; ( i used itunes on a computer separate from my linux computer ) but i could not figure that out .	SOFTWARE#USABILITY
i just ended up using my ipod to transfer my itunes music and i re-downloaded my amazon music ( losing my ratings ) .	SOFTWARE#USABILITY
i would recommend this product to anyone having trouble typing on their ios products , though there are cheaper options ; any new computer users , as it is easy to learn ; and anyone who needs to be efficient , as the gestures make it very easy to multitask .
i have not tried gaming on it but i have heard that mac/apple does not do games well .	LAPTOP#MISCELLANEOUS
i plan on using my macbook pro for a long time .	LAPTOP#GENERAL
when i decided to buy my first computer , i wish i had bought a mac first .	LAPTOP#GENERAL
if the price does n't deter you , you 'll find it well worth it in terms of trouble-free operation .	LAPTOP#PRICE	LAPTOP#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE
i 've had it for more than a year , and i 've found that no anti-virus software is needed , as long as you do n't download anything without being 100 % sure that it 's from a legitimate source .	LAPTOP#QUALITY
( updates and plug-ins should also be treated with caution ; it 's a good idea to google first and see whether other users have had problems with these items . )
from time to time i get the 'spinning beach ball ' that holds up progress .	LAPTOP#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE
i can almost always fix that quickly by clicking on the 'show all bookmarks ' icon ( the open book icon at the upper left ) .	LAPTOP#USABILITY
once in a long while that does n't work ; in that case i turn the computer off , then on again , and sign in -- problem solved .	LAPTOP#USABILITY
i 'll leave the more technical aspects to those more knowledgeable than myself , and just conclude by saying that i 'm delighted with my purchase .	LAPTOP#GENERAL
p.s . : a friend who knows a great deal about computers started with windows ; then he bought a mac mini .
for a time he used both ; now he uses his mac exclusively .
'nuff said ?
received this item and everything is great except that my touchpad is reversed .	LAPTOP#GENERAL	MOUSE#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE
to go left i have to go right and vice versa and to go up i have to go down .	MOUSE#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE	MOUSE#USABILITY
when i attach a mouse it 's fine but the touchpad is really annoying .	MOUSE#USABILITY
i went through the settings and there is n't a way to fix it .	MOUSE#USABILITY
thinking i received the laptop with a faulty touchpad driver installed .
if anyone can help me out on this , that would be great .
it 's a great laptop , but right now it 's annoying to use the touchpad .	LAPTOP#GENERAL	MOUSE#USABILITY
