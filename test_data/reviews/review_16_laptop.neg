being a pc user my whole life ... .
macs are amazing ! ! !
as a lifelong windows user , i was extremely pleased to make the change to mac .
i did contact hp and share how unhappy i am .
yes , i have it on the highest available setting .
easy to start up and does not overheat as much as other laptops .
love that it does n't take up space like a regular computer .
granted , it 's still a very new laptop but in comparison to my previous laptops and desktops , my mac boots up noticeably quicker .
i purchased this laptop 9 months ago !
i am currently out of town and called to inform them the broken part would be returned when i got back in town .
the # 1 reason that is always repeated .
the macbooks worth every penny .
they 're easy , fun , powerful and will last a long time .
the great 18 month same as cash financing and advance protection plan which includes accidents like spills . , which apple does n't offer , is why i bought my macbook at best buy .
i was so excited to receive the toshiba l455 as a gift/bonus for some work i had done for a friend of mine !
i have owned it only two months !
it 's perfect for everything and runs faster than an average pc !
i sent it to them to fix in perfect condition but for what was wrong with it .
i 've been a pc user and i just finally switched and i am never going back .
much faster than my old windows laptop that died on me .
i am also upset with cr for giving a good rating .
i purchased this netbook after my original toshiba laptop crashed right after the warranty expired .
to my mind much more usable than the toy called an ipad .
consumer report recommended toshiba .
i really wanted a mac over a pc because i used a mac in high school .
i like it better than my big dell laptop .
seriously considering a larger laptop to replace the dell
my son and his family have a hard time financially because he is self-employed so the family had no computer of any kind , and kyle the oldest child is 12 and really need something to help him in school .
so we got a good deal on hsn for an ascer notebook and we bought it for him .
now he mows yards so he can earn the money for the wireless internet .
laptop is to be used like a netbook .
this is my second laptop , and it is head and shoulders above my first .
i have used a computer at work but having your own personal laptop is awsome !
this is the first laptop i 've owned , althougth i used several at my previous job .
i would definitely not go back to using a pc after using the mac .
i did not have to call the support line at all .
i purchased two laptops ( for my husband and 16 year old daughter ) .
my husband uses it mostly for games , email and music .
my daughter uses it for games , email , facebook , pictures and music .
purchased as a gift for a friend .
2nd mac book i have purchased from macconnection .
i have other computers that get strong signals that do n't drop in places that this `` net '' book loses its signal .
i shopped around before buying .
if you want a little more custom ability , drop a few bucks and upgrade to one of the more robust versions of win 7 and grab a 2gb stick of memory to spice it all up a bit more .
( i found a 2gb stick for a bit under $ 50 )
my only issues are :
okay , let 's just start out by saying i am in no way a computer techy .
i am a wife , mom and a school teacher and a college student .
trying to balance all of my roles leaves very little time for me to do anything , so i want to manage my time i do have to be the most efficient .
i work on a pc at home and have used pc all through college .
i use the computer to basically check emails , surf the web , print coupons and for my college papers .
i was getting extrememly frustrated when i would want to do these simple taks that i would have to wait and wait and wait for things to download or virus that would clog up my pc .
it would take up too much time to do reaearch for my papers and i would be up hours-just because the computer was too slow .
my brother is a computer wiz and would laugh at me because he used an apple .
finally , i could n't take it anymore and ordered my apple .
i was looking for a mac which is portable and has all the features that i was looking for .
i would recommend anyone to buy from pcconnection express .
the battery life also does n't keep up with the claim but still i think macbook is much ahead from the rest of the pack .
this was an update from an early macbook pro .
thanks , macconnection , for making this a seamless purchase !
this is my 3rd apple laptop and first macbook pro .
probably not ever again .
after that i turned to email in my next vain help to get them to acknowledge that the warranty was still valid .
after that the said it was under warranty .
so this review might be a tad bit bias .
but if you are in the computer field you probably would n't be here . : )
hope this helped !
no laptop is perfect , but sometimes you just find a computer that works for you .
i bought this laptop so that the entire family had a computer in the living room ;
the two of us use it regularly .
i wanted something that had a new intel core processors and hdmi port so that we could hook it up directly to our tv .
i looked around and based off my price/features comparison from a brand i trusted i landed here .
both my husband and i have this model toshiba .
i 'll wait and save up for a new one .
unfortunately , that is not the case .
because we did not purchase the extended warranty in time , we are on the hook for the repair .
the genius at the apple store advised me that there was nothing about my use of the computer that caused this failure .
in fact , he said , about 10 % of their products fail .
hmmm - that high failure rate sure is n't reflected in the retail price .
this is the third macbook pro in our family .
i bought my first macbook after seeing the product demonstrated .
i own other macs but always find myself navigation to the macbook pro to get my work done .
i can do pretty much 75 % of what i do on my desktop on my kitchen table .
she ca n't tell the difference between it and her regular desktop system .
the toshiba laptop i am using is easier to use than most i have tried .
i am finding my way around this laptop better than my last one .
now when i order i did not go full scale for the webcam or full keyboard i wanted something for basics of being easy to carry when i use crutchs or wheelchair and with a backpack laptop bag .
bought it to use mostly for oline classes .
i use that alot on my desktop , so i am adjusting to not having it .
sells for the same as a netbook without sacrificing size .
this was the second computer and brand bought that day .
heck , i like all mac computers , but they 're all way too pricey for the kind of economy the u.s. is going through .
this is my first personal satellite purchase but had very good experience through previous satellite work issued laptops .
i mainly use it for email , internet , and managing personal files ( pics , vids , etc . ) .
i previously owned a toshiba and it only lasted about 2 years .
i have owned macbook pros since 2005 and this is the best yet !
i have had no problems with it unlike some hardware defects on past models .
navigation through the computer is far superior compared to windows operating systems , as well .
even though it is much more expensive than many pc laptops , it is worth the price .
yes , a mac is much more money than the average laptop out there , but there is no comparison in style , speed and just cool factor .
bought from wal-mart , i believe that this laptop was a repaired item .
we purchased this as a back up computer after our more expensive hp needed to be repaired .
i still see the benefits of a pc when i do not know how to do something on my mac .
the keyboard is like no other laptop keyboard .
one suggestion i do have , is to not bother getting microsoft office for the mac expecting it will work just like you knew it to on a pc .
having someone give you a quick tour of how to 's is the best .
so you do n't get frustrated the first few weeks .
the only thing i wish this had was the option to turn off the touchpad with a button like my big 16 '' laptop does .
i have used both pcs and macs and i have to say that i really really love my mac book pro .
while most people say that pcs hold functionality and value and macs are just pretty to look at , i think there 's something to be said about the simplicity of macs .
have had many higher priced computers crash and burn long before ever got to use all that great memory and speed , etc .
we now own two of these , identical .
as an owner of a toshiba satalite laptop computer things you should know before you buy .
two of the times was in one month .
i had in the past a dell laptop and they sent me the items it needed or they sent a repair technician to my house to fix it .
this has happened three times so far .
two times with in one month .
i am not one to throw things like this around but it is a laptop so carrying it around does seem to mean it will be jerked possibly a little , while driving a car and carrying it into where ever you are using it .
finally , i should note that i took the 2gb ram stick from my old eeepc and installed it before i even powered on for the first time .
i called their repair depot as was told they would send me a new box to return the computer to the repair depot .
by air sounds more like by truck to me .
i 've had this laptop for about a month now .
the ati graphics card is a huge plus , definitely a good value if you need to be able to run some slightly older games that a intel built-in card would have trouble with , such as half-life 2 or even world of warcraft .
this is my second macbook .
the first one i had was a 2006 model , not the pro .
i fell in love with it .
i had upgraded my old macbook to lion , so i kind of knew what i was getting , but had n't been able to enjoy some of the awesome new multi-touch features .
the feel of this machine compared to the old macbook is far superior .
my real problem with it ?
it 's a joke .
this ai n't it .
this computer was bought because i wanted `` top of the line '' , fast , reliable , ha .
my husband got me this for chrismas after getting me a very expensve laptop that did not work after 2 days .
so we exchanged it for the same on and after 2 hours it did n't work .
i went with him and we picked this one .
my dad has one of the very first toshibas ever made , yes its abit slow now but still works well and i hooked to my ethernet !
i purchased a toshiba satellite m60 ( with harman/kardon speakers ! ) in december of 2005 .
it still serves me well both in business and home needs .
it is , however , very heavy .
i am a freelance graphic artist .
i need graphic power to run my adobe creative apps efficiently .
it is much faster than my desktop which is a core2 quad running at 2.83 ghz .
i personally like the gaming look but needed a machine that delivered gaming performance while still looking professional in front of my customers .
if that is the case for you , i would suggest a pull-behind solution when looking at cases .
most of the large bags are for a 17 inch .
you may need to special order a bag .
pay attention to the specs if you want these options .
i should have been more observant .
they are not .
well , i have to say since i bought my mac , i wo n't ever go back to any windows .
have not yet needed any customer support with this yet so to me that is a great thing , which is leaps and bounds ahead of pc in my opinion .
i can hardly wait to see whats around the next corner .
my iphone synced right up just like a person would expect , unlike the pcs in our lives .
if only bill gates would read some of what is said here ms would do a better job .
been a pc user for many , many years .
although i opted for the lowest end macbook pro , this thing holds its own .
that is how it is able to function better than any other pc .
first things first , macbook pro has many applications to make life easier , unlike the windows computers .
i took 3-4 years researching brands and prices of laptops .
the only thing i did n't learn in my research was the software i would need like privacy protection and warranty protection , in case it gets broken , or crashes etc .
i do n't have that additional money right now , and therefore would n't have purchased it at this time .
those things are very important - vital even !
so think about factoring those things in when you purchase .
i will have to purchase spy ware or nortell for privacy protection .
thank you .
this laptop is the most amazing little peice of machinery i have owned outside of the iphone .
it took me a while top get away from the land of pcs , but now that i have , i ca n't see myself going back to it .
the keyboard is slick and quiet and not bulky like some other laptops i have had in the past .
this a starter notebook .
if you check you will find the same notebook with the above missing ports and a dual core amd or intel processor .
i would not recommend this to anyone wanting a notebook expecting the performance of a desktop it does not meet the expectations .
i purchased this laptop while on a business trip to keep up with my email .
i had left my regular laptop at home and needed something to use while out of town .
i love windows 7 which is a vast improvment over vista .
i have been a mac user since the mid 90s .
i grew up in a design family so it only made sense .
since i keyboard over 100 wpm , i look for a unit that has a comfortble keyboard ( no keys sticking or lagging , strange configuration of `` extra key '' , etc .
most laptops and notebooks are difficult to key on .
this unit is not .
the resolution is even higher then any other laptop on the market .
i went to my local best buy looking for a new laptop since mine broke .
i know there are way better laptops out there for the same price , and why spend money on shit when you can go out and get yourself a perfectly decent laptop that doesnt suck total monkey balls .
summary : after doing some investigation on the web , i have found that toshiba nb205s are not chronically not booting .
after a couple of years , my battery life began to diminish but was replaced for free due to a company-wide recall of my particular battery .
while there are occasions that my computer will freeze or will need to be manually shut down , this occurs far less frequently than on pc computers and laptops that i 've used .
it absolutely is more expensive than most pc laptops , but the ease of use , security , and minimal problems that have arisen make it well worth the pricetag .
i have owned many computers and laptops .
this is one of the reasons i purchased it .
this is the first macbook i have ever had .
i came from the dell laptops and now i am so glad i switched when i needed a new laptop .
the macbooks are small enough to be very portable yet hold tons of information and performance .
although the price is higher then dell laptops , the macbooks are worth the dough .
dells are ok , hps are n't that good , but macs or fantastic .
if you want more information on macs i suggest going to apple.com and heading towards the macbook page for more information on the applications .
i was n't a big fan of the netbooks but this one was very well designed .
while lacking some of the functions of the other versions , this was very acceptable for the uses planned for this computer .
i have had several machines over the years , both for personal and business use .
all of them were windows machines .
do n't get me wrong , i am no microsoft hater , i 've just managed to turn into a much bigger apple fan because of this machine .
( i had been a windows/linux user before this )
the neat and organized icon list is a welcome change from cluttered and confusing desktop icons .
i 've always owned a pc and decided to try a macbook to see what it 's all about .
i 'm so glad i purchased a mac and not another pc ! ! !
i bought for my son in the 2nd grade .
the difference in the apple keyboard from a pc 's keyboard took a bit of tim to get used to , but overall it 's worth it !
my kids have to take their pcs in once a year to have them `` de-bugged '' .
i work in film editing and post production , so i need a laptop that not only has power , but memory and speed as well .
i ca n't imagine ever buying a pc again !
i have had a mac for 6 years and wo n't go back to pc .
my sister has the same mac as me and she is in a band and uses garageband to record and edit .
i have had another mac , but it got slow due to an older operating system .
i simply got tired of a bad computer like windows with its constant freezing and anti-virus .
i got my macbook pro because i wanted to do all the stuff i need to do without worrying about the system quitting on me or freezing for a few minutes .
take the simple , easy solution to your computer problems and stop waiting and smacking your old computer around .
i 've had my macbook pro since august 2009 .
prior to this computer , i owned a powerbook g4 for 6 years ( quite a long time for a laptop ) .
on my powerbook g4 i would never use the trackpad i would use an external mouse because i did n't like the trackpad .
the display is incredibly bright , much brighter than my powerbook and very crisp .
i also purchased iwork to go with it which has programs for word processing , spreadsheets , and presentations ( similar to microsoft office ) .
i like those programs better than office and you can save your files to be completely compatible with the office programs as well .
it does n't bother me though .
it does n't heat up like my old laptop .
mom , dad , brother , sister , you name it !
i just recently had to ship my laptop back to hp for repair .
one of the smartest thing i did was take my time to compare laptops before making my purchase .
i will stack it up against laptops that cost twice as much any day .
i would never go back any more , i love this computer so much and i would recommend it to everyone .
this computer is a little more expensive than any pc but it will last you longer and it worth every penny .
do yourself a favor , this is not a fake story trying to hurt alienware ...
do a quick search on the internet see if im the only one .
i 'm new - just switched from years of pc frustration .
thank you best buy for putting my computer together and installing my first software - you guys were great too !
not the day received .
its sad because their commercials are great .
i babyed the heck out of it and i still do .
before we got this laptop , had a compaq pasaro for 5 years with no problems .
after the bad experience with this computer went back to compaq .
i was psyched .
i thought all my problems would finally be solved being that my old computer would n't go onto our wireless network and i would n't have the same problems because it was updated .
i use my friends and family 's $ 2000 laptops and they are fast and reliable and hp , well , i 'll never buy or recommend an hp to anyone !
bought notebook 07/2009 .
i bought this laptop the moment unibody product came to the market .
i also bought one for my wife , and 3 for my office .
this is what they told me : it heats up , and that is the reason we no longer call them laptops , and simply categorize them as portables .
you might think , i am new in this game , but i am a gadget lover , and have had more than 2 dozens laptops in the past 15 years , and none gets this hot , that fast .
i also experience the same with my macbook air .
so you might ask , what did apple do for me ?
sad very sad .
i had meant to purchase the nb205 and bought this one by accident ( long story ) .
i have had the netbook for 2 months and i love it , i read some reviews that say netbooks are slow but it does not seem any slower than the other computers i use .
i paid for extra memory and the 17-inch screen , as well as the top of the line dvd and cd burners .
finally was able to reach a young lady in california and ordered the machine and was subsequently given a delivery date .
the leather carrying case , keyboard and mouse arrived in two days from memphis warehouse .
accordingly , i have decided to never purchase another hp product ( my five year old compaq ) lasted 5-years before the hard drive crashed .
i visited the apple store and was impressed with the 17-inch macbook pro .
the quality , engineering design and warranty are superior -- covers damage from dropping the laptop .
if the number of patrons in the apple store are any indication , hp and other pc manufacturers need to take note .
call tech support , standard email the form and fax it back in to us .
i called back to ensure that received it , they had .
asked the customer service rep .
if it 's not shipped on the next business day , called on a friday they are closed on weekends , what was the next step .
was searching online for a power supply when i found this site .
i spoke with a service rep at micro center and his girlfriend is having the same problem with her power adapter , so it 's not just an isolated incident ! ! !
i know that everyone thinks macs are overpriced and overrated , but once you get past the initial expense you 'll find that they 're worth every penny ( besides , there 's always the financing plan that best buy offers ) .
it 's also very capable of doing moderate video editing ( although you may need the performance boost of the larger macbook pros for heavy duty mobile video editing ) .
typically , when i purchase a new laptop i always end up using an external mouse for convenience .
me and my boyfriend bought the gateway nv78 in nov of 09 .
bought with a credit card .
the place we bought it from said that after they send it out to gateway 4 times they would give us a new one .
the last time we took it to get fixed the guy said that most likely it is a reppative problem and will keep happeneing so hopefully we can get a new one very soon !
in the shop , these macbooks are encased in a soft rubber enclosure - so you will never know about the razor edge until you buy it , get it home , break the seal and use it ( very clever con ) .
buy this if you like being tortured , teased , frustrated and wasting twice as much time as you spent using your old mac .
i 'm going to try and keep my old g4 on the road for as long as possible .
this is the first time that i tried and owning a netbook although i have used 3 different laptops in the past 10 years , i find not much difference except of course for the screen size .
i 've owned every `` pro '' model apple laptop for the last 8 years , this is by far the worst one i 've ever had .
i have had some excellent computer and have found i had no idea what to do with them
i saw this one , and i have the most difficult time trying to use them , they 've made great dust collectors , i hate putting this computer down
the computer loads in about a 1/10th of the time that my pc did , and i have all of the programs that were on my pc .
i 'm hoping that i can find a really quick way to clean it without it getting too gross .
i just bought this laptop 3 days ago .
i took it back to the store and exchanged it for another one .
although its windows vista compared to windows xp sucks .
got this for a graduation gift for my daughter for her to use at college .
posted nov 8 , 2010 -
two weeks ago i bought this notebook .
what can i say .
the first programm i switched on was a game for my children .
going to bring it to service today .
i just ca n't fathom that the celebrated dell would last a week in environment of free competition with normal products - it only survives b/c its substandard laptops are forced onto captive students and employees through question-raising programs .
enough said .
applications respond immediately ( not like the tired ms applications ) .
i can actually get work done with this mac , and not fight with it like my tired old pc laptop .
the apple applications ( ex.iphoto ) are fun , easy , and really cool to use ( unlike the competition ) !
after doing cad work all day at work , using a higher end pc , i could n't come home and settle for the use of a lower end computer .
i am definitely sold , and not going back to pcs for home use !
i previously owned an hp desktop and a dell laptop .
both computers started acting extremely slow within the first year of owning them .
the applications are also very easy to find and maneuver , much easier than any other computer i have ever owned .
i should have sent it back to them then .
i had a toshiba for 10 years .
i 'll stick to tashiba .
i have used different laptops in the past and i have to rate this one way above the rest .
the newer black keyboard took a little bit away from the previous gray one which looked really slick , but it is still a great notebook !
i have had my new macbook pro i5 for a couple of days and have recycled all of my old pc laptops .
before i bought my new i5 , i did my research for about 2 weeks and determined to move for hp to apple for reliability , dependable , and long lasting operations .
do n't waste their money , save it and but a mac .
i am not much of a computer techie , so i can understand some of the internal problems , though i do have trend micro as an antiviral program .
my last computer , a toshiba , cost only $ 400 , and worked like a charm for many years .
i now travel with this laptop and my work pc .
i love the mac so much better than my work pc !
i will never go back to windows !
never any doubt i would get a macbook , just was n't sure which one .
after talking it over with the very knowledgeable sales associate , i chose the macbook pro over the white macbook .
i realize that not every unit has this issue , but the ones that do can not be repaired .
instead of taking another chance on toshiba , i went with an asus g73jh-x3 .
they offer the best warranty in the business , and do n't 3rd party it out like toshiba .
for the same price , you get a lot more in the asus ... .1920x1080 res./ awesome cooling system/ much better grafics card ( ati 5870 ) / 8gb ram/ led backlit screen ...
it was a hard decision for me since the macbook pro looked so appealing .
but to be honest , i do n't use my computer for anything like graphics editing and complex data analysis and gaming .
it was also cheaper than the pro which made it even more appealing to me .
sadly apple has discontinued this macbook , i think it was never super popular since it fell somewhere in between the cheapest white model and the smaller pros .
i bought this laptop about a month ago to replace my compaq laptop .
i paid about the same for my toshiba as i did for the compaq a few years back .
no complaints with their desktop , and maybe because it just sits on your desktop , and you do n't carry it around , which could jar the hard drive , or the motherboard .
bought this gateway m-50 or 150 early 2007 .
i had never owned a mac before ;
i had always used pcs and been constantly frustrated by the crashing and the poorly designed operating systems that were never very intuitive .
for 2 months .
oh , boy !
i 'm going back to pc .
at least those computers did n't just die on me like this one .
i always swore by pcs and would never consider a mac .
as it turns out , i just did n't know any better .
this is the first apple product that i have purchased .
about 1/2 of the sites i need to visit because of my work contain some type of flash .
one of the primary reasons why i purchased an ipad was to store photographs so that i could show to my customers .
i go to purchase it on line , and i find out that the device will not be available until almost two months later !
i now realize that my $ 900 would have been better spent on a windows laptop .
hp said it was out of warranty .
if you had pc for four years i can almost gaurentee that something would of gone wrong by now , maybe even forcing you to replace your entire computer .
everything is so easy to use , mac software is just so much simpler than microsoft software .
i feel that enough people have macs these days and that companies need to start making things more compatable than they used to be .
just to be clear .
i have been an apple user since they switched to intel .
i have had macbook pros and macbook airs and have never had a problem .
i purchased it through amazon .
i have had one complaint into the supplier but got little support .
i am taking the computer to apple to see what they think .
the solid-state memory makes it a lot faster than previous macbook pro models that used a spinning hard drive .
if the wi-fi adapter will not support duplex operation ( still trying to get to the bottom of that ) that 's a noticeable drawback i 'll be grousing about for the entire time i use it .
i had searched everywhere for a windows 7 laptop , and all i could find was that awful windows 8 .
this unit will replace my old desktop .
are u serious ?
i wo n't ever buy a computer off amazon again that 's for sure !
thank you !
i bought this laptop computer for my parents , they only access their facebook and e-mail accounts , see family pictures , etc .
i was in a big hurry to buy a computer just to produce a newsletter for my job .
what 's fast enough ?
waiting is horrible , and not waiting is the best thing on earth .
beautifully done , the computer is amazingly faster compared to other version of macbook pro i have had in the past .
overall , the performance and specs are definitely great for the price compared to other laptop of the same price , which make this apple purchase a worthwhile one .
i upgraded the memory from 4gb to 8gb and found the user manual ( which i read while awaiting the laptop to arrive ) more useful than the youtube demo .
also , i find os x much more simple and easy to use than windows .
as a long time pc user , i nearly done using pcs .
get speck cover at the same time !
it 's performing very well after a week 's use and i do n't anticipate any trouble given my past experiences with dell pcs .
in addition to some usage on the road , this is also my desktop unit .
this was recommended to me by an it support specialist in the local school district .
if you are undecided between a desktop or laptop pc , i strongly recommend this pc as a solution .
i live in jamaica and bought this online and my husband took it down for me .
my son saw this laptop online and told be about it and i thought it was a good deal and bought it .
the processor shows a speed of 1.7gz .
i use it for basic web browsing and word processing .
i have also used it to watch youtube and hulu .
i am using primarily for office and outlook while i 'm on the road .
i got this laptop as an upgrade / replacement for my old lenovo notebook .
i did n't have that much money , so i thought i 'd give the inspiron a try .
i do a lot of 10-key so i ca n't be pecking around at the top looking for numbers
i have a lot of antiquated programs that i use that require a download
was easy to get up and running and comes with windows 7 pro ( my favorite operating system so far , do not like windows 8 ) .
i have square trade for it just in case it breaks
replaced a 10 year old hp that never gave us a lick of trouble .
standard issue for company road-warriors where i work .
fantastic machine , i have never believed the hype behind apple products , but must admit i am now a mac user and do not see myself going back .
i would strongly recommend to remove it and install windows 7 on it with a usb drive .
the performance will improve on it .
trust me .
i had a number of updates to do and customization .
bought a spare one for college and one for my mom : d
happy shopping guys
i was very impressed by the sellers speedy two-day delivery , which was free !
thank you !
actually streams better than my regular desk top computer .
now i lay a pillow on my lap first .
problem solved .
ouch .
i just tried to restart it .
i hope they can fix it somehow .
going to see what lenovo does .
got it for my wife .
this is not my first dell laptop .
i 've owned other models , as well .
this one does n't seem to be the same quality as ones i have purchased before .
i just bought this laptop yesterday .
this is how i feel about the laptop so far :
5.best to use the power supply for 4k video viewing .
there are too many things to test .
will update my review when i have time .
bought it for my wife as a birthday present having owned a dell in the past which was a great computer .
i promptly sent it back for an exchange thinking this was just a bad one and surely the next one would be fine .
and i have pictures on there with no way to retrieve them !
had to call dell to get it back online .
never again .
my very first laptop was a dell and it never failed me .
it was stubborn as hell , no amount of dust or slipping to the ground phased it .
it worked super fast and got the job done .
all i needed this for was to do some typing and simple internet browsing and maybe watching netflix here and there .
i know its not my internet connection because i have an hp as well and its like lightening even with the mass of data and info i have on it .
disclaimer : i 'm a mac user .
i wanted to love this laptop , which i bought as a transitional laptop to use between jobs , before my new university gave me one .
if you have zero dollars , consider it .
if you want ease of use and long-term happiness , buy a macbook .
i built my own gaming pc with a intel i5-4590 in it and a gtx 760 so i know what crazy performance on a computer can come to .
no need to .
very frustrating .
so frustrating ! !
i bought this laptop in november 2013 .
hp please fix it .
i 've been a loyal dell user for quite some time .
but every six months my dell computer crashes .
since i also do a lot of writing and illustrations using adobe products , i thought i would try a mac .
i 'll keep trying however .
i wavered between another toshiba and this and ended up choosing this and i 'm so sorry i did .
the laptop has 4g and a 2.9g processor and it 's slower than the four year old toshiba i replaced .
most of my things are stored in the cloud .
looked up the manual on another computer .
the manual said that particular series of beeps indicated a video problem .
have the unit serviced .
lenovo sent me a box to return it to them .
they claim they will have it back in six working days .
we 'll see .
once i get a working computer , i think i will like it .
i 've had lenovo computers before .
get a probook instead .
was this computer refurbished ?
help !
i bought this for my 9 year old for a birthday gift .
he uses to play mine craft and school work .
the keyboard is not as easy to use as my old sony ...
i bought this so that i could sit on the couch and surf internet with a larger screen than ipad was offering .
the reviews at the time in late july 2014 were mostly positive and it was the best selling laptop with almost 4 star review ...
i tried all the window updates ( this worked for a couple of hp laptops i7in that i bought later at bb ) to see if it could remove the drag , it did not .
really at this point i am trying to confirm if the ram can be upgraded to see if i can do that to help .
couple that with lack of inbuilt bluetooth , dvd drive you are looking at a close tie ( or even a loss ) compared with the other laptops on sale in mid to late august 2014 .
the hp laptops 17in ( with i3 core and amd ) i mentioned before from the other big electronic bb store smoked this one even before i updated windows and upped the ram .
but alas they were gifts ... and what is a gift if not given ?
but then again hindsight is 20/20 .
bought a usb dvd rw drive but have not used it yet .
i was nervous at first that i purchased a lemon but the user manual explains how to turn on the keyboard backlight .
amazon had the best pricing and the delivery was on time .
save your money and get an android : works better , more support
